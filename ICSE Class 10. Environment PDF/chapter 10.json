  "10.1. INTRODUCTION",
  "Groups of people have moved from place to place throughout the human history. The act of",
  "coming to live in a foreign country by any group of people is called as Immigration. On the other",
  "hand, the act of leaving a country, habitat or the resource base by any group of people is called asEmigration.",
  "History reveals that large numbers of people have fled from their homelands because of different",
  "types of disasters such as epidemics, hunger or war. On the contrary, tourism, recreation, surveys and",
  "other  study  objectives,  spread  of  religion  etc.  have  also  been  some  specific  reasons  behind  the",
  "movements of different groups of people. But, here in this lesson, we are basically concerned to",
  "factors and conditions that disrupt livelihood of people, deprive them of their natural resources and",
  "enforce them to leave their habitat for resettlement and rehabilitation. Let us try to understand these",
  "terms first.",
  "10.2. DISPLACEMENT, RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION",
  "The act of compulsory acquisition of land for different purposes and forcing people to give",
  "up their homes, resource bases, assets and means of livelihood is called as displacement. Large",
  "scale  displacement  of  people  occurs  due  to  Mega  River  Valley  Projects,  establishment  of  big",
  "industries,  mining  activities,  development  of  canal  systems,  railway  constructions  and  Natural",
  "Disasters.",
  "Displaced people have to settle on a suitable place which may serve as a favourable place",
  "for their living and development. They settle on a new place usually with the intention of making",
  "permanent new settlement. This is called as resettlement.",
  "In many cases migrants of some areas use to occupy government places without any provision",
  "from the government side. This leads to the problem of encroachment and development of slums in the",
  "later course. The government favoured resettlement is observed in cases of displacement due to mega",
  "projects. For the resettlement of displaced people due to a project, the declaration of an area under",
  "Para 5.12 of the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation -2003, Government of India,",
  "by  the  appropriate  Government  acquired  or  proposed  to  be  acquired  for  resettlement  and",
  "rehabilitation of project affected families is called as a Resettlement Zone.",
  "10.2.1. Issues Involved in Displacement and Resettlement",
  "Human  Rights,  governance  and  accountability,  participation  and  self  determination  in",
  "development, complexities of resettlement goals, options and strategies, relevant policy and legal",
  "instrument- are some important issues that are involved in displacement and resettlement.",
  "10.2.2. Resettlement and Development",
  "Forced displacement of people has its deleterious and traumatic consequences. It is a distressful",
  "and potentially destructive experience. Hence, it requires affirmative actions for the mitigation of",
  "deleterious and traumatic effects.",
  "According to the World Commission on Dams- Report, March 16, 2000; resettlement must be",
  "planned and implemented as a developmental project over a minimum of two generations and include",
  "not only protective measures but also the provisions of new rights, resources and strategies. Through",
  "resettlement, the project authority or the administrator tries to restore the status quo ante and makes",
  "available the material assets to project affected families. But these things do not go to fulfil the",
  "requirement.  The  resettlement  of  people  should  also  incorporate  the  improvement  in  the  living",
  "standard besides restoration of pre- relocation of living.",
  "The result of resettlement conceived as development of project affected people besidestheir relocation and development of incomes, is called as Rehabilitation.",
  "In other words, the arrangement for resettlement of people in distress due to displacement and",
  "provisions of housing, employment, recreation, education, medical aid etc. to the displaced people is",
  "called as rehabilitation. The rehabilitation is rather a vocational process of preparing people with",
  "physical, sensory, emotional development, employment and helping them cope effectively with their",
  "environment and to function as independently as possible.",
  "According  to  the  report  of  The  World  Commission  on  Dams  (March16,  2000),  the",
  "rehabilitation should also incorporate following elements \u2013",
  "(a) Enhancement of capabilities of people,",
  "(b) Expansion of social opportunities by addressing the social and personal constraints that",
  "restrict people\u2019s choices,",
  "(c) Landlessness should be converted to land- based settlement,",
  "(d) Joblessness should be substituted with employment,",
  "(e) Provisions of safe nutrition,",
  "(f) Construction of houses,",
  "(g) Improvements in health and wellbeing,",
  "(h) Community reconstructions and social inclusions.",
  "The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration started was on July 1, 1947.",
  "Among services supplied by the UNRRA, the maintenance of refugee camps, vocational training,",
  "orientation for settlement and an extensive tracing service to find lost relatives come on the priority",
  "basis.  The  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  (R  &R)  of  people  affected  due  to  natural  calamities",
  "involve services like medical, Psychological, preparation for work etc.",
  "10.3. CAUSES OF DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE",
  "Fig. 10.1. Scene of a devastating cyclone.",
  "The displacement of people from their habitat is caused due to several factors. These factors are",
  "kept under two major categories- Natural causes and Man-made causes.",
  "The  Natural  causes  of  displacement  of  people  comprise  volcanic  eruptions,  floods,",
  "earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis, etc. Each one of these causes is seriously dangerous, as each one of",
  "these cause large scale devastation of life and property.The Man-made causes of displacement of people are listed below \u2013",
  "\u2666 Construction  of  mega-  dams  under  River  Valley  Projects  for  irrigation  and  power",
  "generation.",
  "\u2666 Activities  related  to  mining  projects  that  involve  large  scale  cutting  of  forests  and",
  "clearance of land which finally result into large scale displacement of people.",
  "\u2666 Reservation of large areas of land as National Parks, Biosphere Reserves, Sanctuaries etc.",
  "lead to forced migration of people.",
  "\u2666 Scarcity of resources and adverse conditions in the home environment enforce people to",
  "migrate to resource rich and favourable environment.",
  "\u2666 Construction  of  roads,  rail  tracks,  flyovers  etc.  and  establishment  of  industries  cause",
  "compulsory displacement of people with little or no compensation.",
  "There are still a number of man-made causes of migration and displacement of people from their",
  "original habitats to some new habitats. Scarcity of food and other resources due to explosion of",
  "population, defeat in war (as during the World War II, in 1945), desires for material gains (as during",
  "13th century invasion by Turkish tribes on wealthy cities of Western Asia), search for religious and",
  "political freedom, change in climate, search for warmer or colder regions are some of the other",
  "reasons that stimulate people for movement to other habitats.",
  "10.4. IMPACT OF DISPLACEMENT ON PEOPLE",
  "The displacement of people from their habitats causes various types of risks on the parts of the",
  "affected  people.  It  causes  the  risks  of  landlessness,  joblessness,  homelessness,  marginalization,",
  "increased morbidity and mortality, food insecurity, loss of access to common property resources and",
  "services, and social disturbances.",
  "Besides the above, some of the major impacts of displacement are listed below\u2013",
  "Fig. 10.2. Refuge camp of tribal people who often have to face multiple displacement.",
  "1. After displacement, the resettlement programmes usually loose momentum once the people",
  "are shifted out of the particular place. According to the World Commission on Dams,",
  "the focus on resettlement programmes remains always to simply get people to move",
  "\u2018out of the way\u2019 to the resettlement sites as quickly and smoothly as possible. The",
  "displaced and resettled people are usually forgotten once their physical relocation iscomplete.",
  "2. It has been observed that indigenous tribal people are subjected to multiple displacements",
  "as  their  lands  are  not  considered  to  be  legal.  These  people  often  do  not  get  any",
  "compensation for their lands and other properties.",
  "3. The basic amenities and essential infrastructure such as schooling, health facilities, credit,",
  "agriculture,  employment,  etc.  often  remain  incomplete  at  resettlement  sites.  These",
  "conditions cause long lasting suffering to people.",
  "4. Forced  displacement  and  relocation  destroys  production  processes  of  various  social",
  "organisations. It breaks the network of relationships and allocation of resources as well",
  "as individual and community rights.",
  "5. The people of displacement areas become poorer even before their real displacement",
  "as they have to break their occupational and financial schemes they use to run for years.",
  "6. Displaced people often do not receive full compensation. They are very frequently cheated",
  "by corrupt agents and office staff.",
  "7. In cases of natural calamities and in other cases too, the displaced people are temporarily",
  "shifted to refugee camps. In some cases these people become permanent refugees and the",
  "refugee camps become their permanent homes that are later managed and repaired by",
  "themselves.",
  "8. In some cases lands of poor farmers and tribal people are forcefully acquired for private",
  "mining and industrial purposes. Such cases have been observed in Maharashtra and",
  "Orissa where people were forcibly displaced for grabbing their lands for mining and",
  "other industrial purposes.",
  "enviro_Facts : 10",
  "The construction of mega dams and other such projects create large scale devastation and destruction of resource bases of",
  "local people. One painful example is the submergence of the Traditional Tehri town set up in 1815 by Sudershan Shah due to the",
  "construction of asia\u2019s highest Tehri Dam (height 260 meters) on Bhagirathi River. On the construction of this dam the Gandhian",
  "styled activist, has said,\u201dThis is a dam built with our tears.\u201d The traumatic conditions of displaced people, inadequate rehabilitation",
  "etc. are giving birth to a number of social organisations and movements in the affected areas. Some of the social organisations of",
  "India fighting for the rehabilitation of displaced people and for the amendments in the Land Acquisition Act- 1984, are \u2013 Tehri",
  "Bandh Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti (TBVSS), Visthapit Mukti Morcha, Jamshed Pur; Indian Social Institute, Delhi; Samaj Parivartan",
  "Samuday, Karnataka; Shramjivi Sangathan, Maharashtra; and Narmada Bachao Andolan(NBA), led by Gandhian styled leader",
  "Medha Patkar) etc.",
  "Fig. 10.3. Submergence of the Tehri town.10.5. STRATEGIES FOR REHABILITATION OF DISPLACED PEOPLE IN",
  "INDIA",
  "A National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Families (PFAs)",
  "-  2003(NPRR-2003),  was  published  in  the  Gazette  of  India,  Extra  Ordinary,  Part-I,  Section-1,",
  "No.-46, on 17th February 2004. This policy aimed at lying down basic norms and packages for the",
  "resettlement and rehabilitation of PAFs. The Policy has been subjected to revision and improvements",
  "from time to time. Accordingly, the Draft National Development, Displacement and Rehabilitation",
  "Policy was released during January, 2006. Some of the principal objectives and provisions are",
  "being listed below \u2013",
  "(i) To minimize displacement and to identify non- displacing or least displacing alternatives,",
  "(ii) To plan the resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected families including special",
  "needs of tribals and vulnerable sections,",
  "(iii) To provide better standards of living to PAFs,",
  "(iv) To facilitate harmonious relationships between the requiring body and PAFs through mutual",
  "co-operations.",
  "Every  displaced  population  has  to  receive  adequate  compensation  according  to  the  Land",
  "Acquisition Act -1994.  In  addition  to  the  legally  due  compensation,  every  displaced  community",
  "should get rehabilitation package as per the Act. Some important features of the rehabilitation",
  "package are listed below \u2013",
  "1.  In  all  irrigation  projects,  it  is  mandatory  that  all  the  displaced  people  who  primarily",
  "depended  on  agriculture  are  settled  within  the  command  area  of  an  irrigation  project.  It  is  the",
  "responsibility of the state to provide land to the Project Affected Populations (PAPs).",
  "2. The unskilled and semiskilled persons out of the project affected population should be given",
  "direct jobs in the project.",
  "3.  The  government  must  undertake  a  special  Employment  Guarantee  Programme  for  a",
  "minimum period of five years.",
  "4. The resettlement sites must be granted the status of special Panchayat. The allocation of",
  "Jawahar Rojgar Yojna (JRY), Indira Aavasiya Yojna (IAY) etc. must be suitably enhanced to cover",
  "the needs of the people.",
  "5. All the displaced families should be provided the homesteads and dwelling units within 50 sq",
  "meters in urban and between 100 sq meters to 250 sq meters in rural areas.",
  "6. The project should bear all the cost of transportation or trans-shipment of a family along with",
  "its domestic animals, moveable properties, moveable building materials and other belongings from",
  "the place of displacement to the place of resettlement.",
  "7. The cost of providing agricultural land, homestead land, constructed houses, shops, working",
  "sheds etc. should be realised from the amount of compensation awarded to the families receiving the",
  "aforesaid packages under different conditions.",
  "8. The resettlement and rehabilitation(RR) authorities shall provide at project cost the necessary",
  "training to develop entrepreneurships and assist the adult members of the displaced families to take",
  "up economically viable self employment projects.",
  "9. All the families who have not been provided agricultural land or a regular job in the projectshall be entitled to rehabilitation grant equivalent to 750 days minimum agricultural wages.",
  "10.  Tribals  should  be  resettled  close  to  their  habitats  so  as  to  ensure  continuation  of  their",
  "traditional rights on minor forest produce and common property resources.",
  "11.  Twenty  six  basic  amenities  and  infrastructural  facilities  must  be  provided  for  en-masse",
  "resettlement. These amenities are- roads, safe drinking water, plantation, educational facilities,",
  "community hall, irrigation facilities etc. These facilities are to be ensured for resettlement and",
  "rehabilitation at the project cost.",
  "Besides  the  above,  there  are  still  a  number  of  facilities  that  are  to  be  provided  to  project",
  "affected families at the cost of the project. Some of those additional provisions are- preferential",
  "rights of allotment of shares of project particularly of companies, and double benefits in case of",
  "multiple displacements.",
  "It has been observed that people from rural areas use to migrate to cities in search of jobs to",
  "earn  money.  This  type  of  migration  can  be  reduced  by  implementing  Swarn  Jayanti  Swa-Rojgar",
  "Yojna, rural-development and improving sustainable agriculture.",
  "10.6. INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS FOR R & R",
  "A  number  of  international  institutions  or  agencies  like  the  World  Bank,  United  Nations",
  "Development Programme(UNDP), Exim Bank of United States and Jexim Bank of Japan etc.",
  "are major financers of building of mega projects(including dams), and resettlement and rehabilitation",
  "programmes. Of these institutions the World Bank Group is a big funder of dams in the world. As per",
  "estimates  it  has  funded  about  US$58  billion  dollars  as  loans  for  construction  of  dams  and",
  "rehabilitation works. The International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank is the",
  "largest  loan  provider  and  equity  financer  for  private  sector  projects.  The  World  Bank  draws",
  "operational directives pertaining to baseline surveys, compensations, relocations, income generations",
  "etc. Among other operational policies of the bank, policies related to protection of environment and",
  "development of indigenous people are of special importance. It is one of the leading institutions in",
  "evolving policies to mitigate the impacts of displacement.",
  "10",
  "TOWARDS A BETTER ENVIRONMENT\u2026",
  "Mega Dams have been reported to cause earthquakes besides causing other forms of destruction in the affected areas.",
  "As such the construction of Sardar Sarovar Dam and Indira Sagar Dam entails serious seismic and ecological risks. Experts are",
  "of the opinion that the vicinity of the location of the Sardar Sarovar dam contains a Seismically Active Centre at the focal depth of",
  "3km. Two faults namely BisarPur and Ambadongar also lie across the area upstream from the reservoir.",
  "In Narmada Valley, two villages namely Vadgam (Gujrat) and Manibeli (Maharashtra) were among the first villages that were",
  "submerged in July 1993 due to the construction of Sardar Sarovar Dam. After the submergence of these villages, the World Bank had",
  "issued a document entitled \u2018Next Step\u2019 on September 11,1993 and had demanded that the submergence should have started one year",
  "after the resettlement of villages. It had threatened to cut development loans unless construction of the dam was slowed down to",
  "synchronise resettlement and rehabilitation(WWF-Publication- 1995). Now that the height of the dam is going to increase from",
  "existing 110 meters to 121 meters,, and the rehabilitation process is found inadequate the volunteers of Narmada Bachao Andolan are",
  "still fighting under the Gandhian styled activist Medha Patkar.",
  "Counter Urbanization",
  "The movement of people out of cities, to the surrounding areas is called as counter urbanization. This process has started in",
  "more economically develped countries since 1950.",
  "Counter urbanization is achieved in following ways-1. Growth of economy leading to increase in public and private transport systems",
  "2. Increasing pollution, crime and congestion in urban areas",
  "3. Search of open, less expensive, and natural spaces",
  "4. Growth of means of communication technology and other facilities in surrounding areas of cities",
