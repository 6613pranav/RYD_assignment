  "The word \u201cwild\u201d relates to \u201cthe nature\u201d and \u201clife\u201d relates to \u201cliving organisms\u201d- plants, animals",
  "and micro- organisms. Thus, Wildlife is a broad term which incorporates all the undomesticated",
  "organisms of the biosphere.",
  "The term wildlife is often restricted to wild animals. In this case, it means just the animals living",
  "in the wild. But, in broad sense, the term wildlife comprises nearly half of the environment. Its next",
  "half is the physical environment.",
  "All the species of organisms inhabiting a particular area (land or water) are together termed as",
  "BIODIVERSITY or Biological Diversity of that area. In other words, \u201cSpecies-richness of a place is",
  "called as its biodiversity.\u201d According to the world Resource Institute, IUCN and UNEP (1992) -",
  "\u201cBiodiversity is the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region.\u201d",
  "Habitat destruction, extensive mining, deforestation, hunting and poaching, pollution and climate",
  "change are acting as potential causes of the loss of biodiversity today. (Elaborate these causes on the",
  "basis of year studies).",
  "As  per  reports  of  UNEP-2000,  we  have  been  able  to  describe  about  1750000  species  of",
  "wildlife in the world so far, whereas the possibility of the total number of species existing in the",
  "world is expected to be 14000 000.",
  "Since, the biological and the physical components together constitute the natural environment;",
  "both the components must be conserved and managed properly. In this chapter, we are going to study",
  "about  the  importance  of  wildlife,  principal  factors  causing  loss  of  species  and  about  various",
  "strategies  that  are  being  adopted  on  the  national  and  the  global  levels  for  the  conservation  and",
  "management of wildlife.",
  "4.2. WILD LIFE IN DISTRESS",
  "The wildlife is in distress in the whole world. Besides facing threats from natural calamities,",
  "animals are facing additional threats from human activities too. The increasing demand for different",
  "types of resources and pollutions of air, water and soil are some of the factors that have put wildlife",
  "in distress across the globe.",
  "4.2.1. The Global Scene",
  "According to the IUCN- Red list-2000, about 1130 species of mammals and 1183 species of",
  "birds have been declared to be threatened on the global level. As per assessment made in 1996, there",
  "were about 169 species of mammals and 168 species of birds considered to be critically threatened",
  "in the world. These numbers increased considerably by the year 2000 and the number of critically",
  "threatened species of birds increased unto 182. The wildlife experts in the world are of the opinion",
  "that with the current trend of loss of species or the extinction, about 15 to 20 percent loss of species",
  "of wildlife is feared to occur over the next 100 years.",
  "Extinction may be defined as a condition when no live individual of a particular species",
  "exists anywhere in the world, either in its natural habitat (in situ) or in captivity (ex- situ).Some",
  "species of wildlife are known to play more significant roles in a particular ecosystems than other",
  "species. Such species are called as key- stone species. The loss of such species becomes seriouslydestructive to ecosystems.",
  "IUCN or the International Union for Conservation of Nature and natural resources has",
  "categorized  plants  and  animals  according  to  their  Ecological  Status  in  the  wild.  Some  of  these",
  "categories are mentioned below-",
  "F Extinct: A species that no longer exists anywhere around the world.",
  "F Critically Endangered: A species that is going to face an extremely high risk of extinction in",
  "the wild in the immediate future.",
  "F Endangered: A species that is going to face a high risk of extinction in the wild in the near",
  "future.",
  "F Vulnerable: A species that is going to face high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-",
  "term future.",
  "F Conservation dependent: A species that is currently the focus of a conservation program. If",
  "the program is halted, the species would suffer and would qualify for one of the threatened",
  "categories above within a period of five years.",
  "F Near Threatened: A species that does not qualify for Conservation Dependent status, but is",
  "close to qualifying for vulnerable status.",
  "4.2.2. The Indian Scene",
  "The Zoological Survey of India and the Botanical Survey of India have surveyed more than",
  "70% of the total geographical area of India for the assessment of total number of species of plants and",
  "animals. So far, about 81,000 species of animals and 49,000 species of plants, have been recorded by",
  "these two institutions, respectively.",
  "According to the IUCN- red list, released on 28th September 2000, the environmental status of",
  "species of plants and animals in India is detailed below.",
  "Table 4.1. Status of species of plants and animals in India",
  "4.3. CAUSES OF LOSS OF SPECIES OF WILDLIFE",
  "The number of species of wildlife is declining through out the world at an unprecedented rate.",
  "Some of the important causes of this loss of species are mentioned below.4.3.1. Habitat Destruction or Conversion of Land",
  "Vast areas of forest lands are being converted into agricultural land, mining land, pasture land",
  "etc. Industrial, residential and municipal construction works grab vast areas of productive land at a",
  "fast rate due to explosion of human population. The varying pattern of land use like agricultural",
  "development, logging, construction of dams, and urban development lead to serious modifications of",
  "habitats. Water bodies like lakes and ponds, wetlands and even coastal lands are being reclaimed for",
  "different purposes. All these practices of habitat destruction are causing decline in the number of",
  "species of wildlife.",
  "Virtually every type of habitat has come under stress over the past three decades. According to",
  "an estimate made by FAO, the forest covers in developing countries declined by 2 million sq. km in",
  "the world annually from 1980 to 1995. About 20 percent of the fresh water species have gone extinct",
  "or threatened.",
  "4.3.2. Climate Change",
  "The climate change has emerged as one of the major potential threats to the existence of wildlife",
  "especially to the small animals. The bleaching of coral reefs has been reported to occur due to rise in",
  "the global temperature. In Indian Ocean, bleaching of coral reefs caused mass mortality of corals (up",
  "to 90%) in an area of more than thousands of sq. kilometres. The decline of amphibian population in",
  "the Tropical Montane forests and mysterious extinction of the golden toads of Florida, have been",
  "reported to be caused due to the changes in the climate. Studies done on the depletion of the ozone",
  "layer  reveal  that  excess  ultra  violet  radiations  reaching  to  the  earth  are  killing  embryos  of",
  "Salamanders due to which these are being vanished from the earth.",
  "Fig. 4.1. Facing Extinction: The Golden Toad of Florida.",
  "4.3.3. Deposition of Nitrogen",
  "The increasing use of fertilizers is causing the deposition of nitrogen in soil which is leading to",
  "the loss of soil organisms. Water bodies are subjected to nitrogen deposition due to joining of surface",
  "run offs from crop fields. This condition leads to eutrophication, increase in the toxic algal bloom and",
  "deaths of aquatic organisms.",
  "The oil spills are causing loss of species of marine animals. A total of 108000 tonnes of oil",
  "were spilled into marine and inland environments as a result of 215 incidents in the world during the",
  "year 1998.4.3.4. Hunting, Poaching and International Trade",
  "Hunting  and  poaching  are  dangerous  practices  causing  mass  scale  loss  of  species  of  wild",
  "animals. Animals are being hunted for meat, sports and illegal trade in their body parts since time",
  "immemorial. One of the most significant forms of hunting is whaling as a result of which stocks of",
  "whales have gone to the brink of extinction in many parts of the world. The international trade in",
  "animal body parts and products derived from them has reached up to the international value of US$",
  "10 000 million per year.",
  "4.3.5. Invasive Species",
  "Plants,  animals,  fungi,  or  microorganisms  that  spread  rapidly  and  cause  harm  to  other",
  "species are called as Invasive Species. Invasive species are sometimes so harmful and damaging",
  "that they threaten an entire ecosystem. An \u201cinvasive species\u201d is defined as a species that is -",
  "(i) Non-native (or alien) to an ecosystem, and",
  "(ii) Whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to",
  "human health.",
  "In fact invasive species may be the species of some foreign organisms that cause harm to",
  "organisms of a new ecosystem when introduced in it. Here are two examples of invasive species",
  "and the impacts of their introduction into new habitats \u2013",
  "1. Euglandina rosea is a species of snails (called as Wolf Snails) found on large scale in",
  "Australia. When some snails of this species somehow reached to Polynesia, they started feeding on",
  "the native snails of the island. Thus the snails of the new species caused serious loss of endemic land",
  "snail species of the Polynesian islands. Polynesia is a sub region of Oceania, comprising a large",
  "grouping of over 1,000 islands scattered over the central and southern Pacific Ocean.",
  "2. The Tasmanian Brush-tail Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a carnivorous animal that is",
  "found everywhere in Australia. When some individuals of this species were introduced in New",
  "Zealand, they started eating away most of the native birds, and the population of native birds declined",
  "severely in that area.",
  "4.3.6. Pollutions",
  "The pollutions of air, water and land are killing vast varieties of birds, insects and aquatic",
  "organisms. The use of different types of deadly pesticides in agriculture is causing mass scale deaths",
  "of field sparrows, pea cocks and other birds. The population of the white-backed vultures is",
  "declining due to the presence of diclofenac in the dead bodies of cattle once treated with this anti-",
  "inflammatory drug. Fortunately, our scientists have become successful in synthesizing a new alternate",
  "drug named Meloxicam. Now the application of diclofenacs has been banned in India.",
  "4.4. NEED OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF WILDLIFE",
  "We know that our environment cannot remain complete or balanced without the existence of",
  "wildlife. We need to conserve and manage our wildlife due to following reasons-Fig. 4.2. A vulcher dead due to consumption of Diclofenac - containing flesh of a dead animal.",
  "1. Living organisms regulate gaseous composition of atmosphere, hydrological cycles, and",
  "climate and soil fertility.",
  "2. Marine organisms are important for the protection of coastal zones.",
  "3. Micro- organisms and certain other animals are important for the disposal and breakdown",
  "of wastes.",
  "4. A large number of insects, birds and other animals are associated with the pollination of",
  "crops and other flowers.",
  "5. Plants play important roles in the absorption of pollutants.",
  "6. Wild organisms serve as important sources of medicines for human health. As per reports",
  "of UNEP-2000, out of 25 top selling drugs in 1997, 10 were derived from wild sources",
  "alone.  The  global  market  value  of  medicines  derived  from  wild  sources  has  been",
  "estimated to be US$ 75000 to 150 000 million annually. About 75 percent of the world",
  "population rely for health care on traditional medicines that are directly derived from",
  "plants and animals growing in the wild.",
  "7. Wild life are regarded as social, cultural, and national assets in India. Hence, we have",
  "National  Bird  and  National  Animal  as  well  as  State  Bird  and  State  Animal  on",
  "government levels.",
  "8. Wildlife constitutes the biological basis for world food security and support for human",
  "livelihood. So many types of wild plants are of great importance to global and national",
  "economies. They are our important genetic resources also.",
  "4.5. MEASURES OF CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF WILDLIFE",
  "India has a rich heritage of wildlife. It has a long history and tradition of conservation of plants",
  "and animals. Principles of conservation are mixed in religious texts and practices in this country.",
  "Kautilya\u2019s Arthshastra contains the concept of making Forest Reserves (Abhayaranyas) for the",
  "protection of state elephants during 3rd. century B.C. Conservation of wildlife has been put into two",
  "major categories-(A) in situ conservation or \u201con-site conservation\u201d in which wildlife is conserved",
  "inside National Parks, wildlife Sanctuaries and biosphere reserves ; (B) ex-situ conservation or",
  "\u201cconservation outside the natural habitat of wilflife\u201d Keeping Gene-Banks, microbial culture andcaptive  breeding  are  some  examples  of  ex-situ  conservation.  Following  are  some  of  the  most",
  "important measures that are being taken up for the conservation and management of wildlife in India",
  "and abroad \u2013",
  "4.5.1. NATIONAL PARKS",
  "A  National  Park  is  an  area  protected  and  preserved  by  law  for  the  protection  and",
  "preservation of flora and fauna within its boundary. Grazing of cattle, removal of any wildlife",
  "from  its  habitat  is  strictly  prohibited  in  a  national  park  and  all  rights  are  reserved  with  the",
  "government. The law defines a national park as an area which is of ecological, faunal, floral and",
  "geomorphologic importance. The Corbett National Park, established in 1935, is considered to be",
  "India\u2019s first national park. The yellow Stone National Park -USA, is considered as first national",
  "park in the world. It was established in 1872 and it has an area of 8983sq km.",
  "According to a report, William Henry Jackson, a photographer and Thomas Moran, an artist,",
  "visited Yellow Stone region in 1871 and brought several photographs from there. Those photographs",
  "moved the public of America and US government and persuaded them to preserve the area. President",
  "Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill creating Yellow Stone a, National Park in 1872.",
  "There are 80 national parks in India. Some of those important national parks are being briefly",
  "introduced here.",
  "1. Corbett National Park: Spread along the bank of the river Ramganga in Uttaranchal (earlier",
  "U.P.), it is India\u2019s First National Park, which was constituted in 1936. This park is spread in an area",
  "of 52,082 hectares. Important wildlife kept in this park are \u2013 tiger, elephant, deer, wild boars, otters",
  "and a number of species of birds.",
  "Fig. 4.3. Scene of a National Park. (Gate of Kanha National Park)",
  "2. Hazaribagh National Park: Located in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand state, this national",
  "park has a wide variety of animals like wild boar, sambhar, nilgai, tiger, leopard, sloth beer, hyena,",
  "and gaur. It has an area of 184 km of thick tropical forest. This national park was notified in the year",
  "1976 and its total area is 18, 625 hectares.3. Kanha National Park:  This  Park  is  basically  a  Tiger  Reserve.  It  is  located  in  Madhya",
  "Pradesh. Some important animals kept in this park are \u2013leopards, langurs, mongoose, Cats, hyena,",
  "porcupine, etc. Sal and bamboos are principal trees in this park besides wide variety of other plants.",
  "This national park was notified in the year 1955 and its area is 94, 000 hectares.",
  "4.  Bandhav  Garh  National  Park:  This  Park  is  located  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  The  principal",
  "animal kept in this park is the White Tiger. Notified in the year 1968, this nation park is spread in the",
  "area of 44,884 hectares.",
  "5. Kajiranga National Park: It is located on the bank of the river Brahmputra in Assam. It is",
  "famous for one Horned Rhinoceros. Besides rhinos, other animals protected in the park are swamp",
  "deer, bison, tiger, leopard, hoolock gibbon, wild buffaloes, pythons, monitor lizards, elephants etc.",
  "Principal plants found in the park are tall elephant grass, Sal trees and different types of bushes. This",
  "national park was notified in the year 1974, and its area is 42, 996 hectares.",
  "6. Dudwa National Park: Located in Lakhimpur Khiri district of Uttar Pradesh, this National",
  "Park supports wide variety of wild animals including re- introduced one- horned rhinos and swamp",
  "deer etc. Other animals in this park are \u2013 crocodiles, leopards, jackals, sambhars and sloth beers.",
  "Principal plants comprise grass species, Sal trees etc. This national park was notified in the year",
  "1977 and its area is 49, 029 hectares.",
  "7. Pench National Park: Located on the southern edge of Madhya Pradesh, this park is named",
  "after the river Pench which flows through this park from north to south. It is the 19th Project Tiger",
  "Reserve in the country. This national park was notified in the year 1977 and it is spread in the area of",
  "29, 286 hectares.",
  "8. The Sundarban National Park: Located in Sundarbans in West Bengal, this national park has",
  "an area of 11, 710 hectares. This is the principal habitat of Royal Bengal Tigers. This park has largest",
  "mangrove vegetation in the world. Other animals supported by this park are deer, chital, rhesus",
  "monkeys etc.",
  "9. Dachigam National Park: This National Park was notified in the year 1981 in the Jammu and",
  "Kashmir (India). This park has an area of 14, 100 hectares. Some of the animals protected in this park",
  "are Kashmiri Stag and Hangul.",
  "10. Gir Forests: This National Park is located in Kathiawar district of Gujarat state of India.",
  "This national park was notified in the year 1965. It is spread in an area of 115, 342 hectares. It is",
  "famous for Gir Lions.",
  "11. Ranthambor National Park: This National Park is located in Rajasthan state of India.",
  "Constituted in the year 1980, this park is spread in an area of 39, 200 hectares. The principal wildlife",
  "protected in this park is crocodile, nilgai, gazelle, sambhar etc.",
  "12. Palamau National Park: Located in Dalton Ganj District of Palamau area of Jharkhand",
  "(previously in Bihar) state of India. This National Park was notified in the year 1986. It has an area of",
  "21, 300 hectares. The flora of this national park comprises thick tropical forests due to which it has",
  "been selected for the Project Tiger, an ambitious project for the protection and propagation of tigersin India. The fauna of this national park comprises tiger, elephant, deer, panther, sloth beer, chital,",
  "gaur, nilgai, chinkara, and mouse deer etc.",
  "13. Simlipal National Park: Located in the district Mayurbhanj of Orissa state of India, this",
  "National Park comprises dense Sal forest due to which this park has been chosen for the Project",
  "Tiger. The fauna of this national park comprises tiger, elephant, deer, pea foul, talking mainas, chital,",
  "sambhar, panther, gaur, hyena, and sloth beer. Notified in the year 1978, this national park is spread in",
  "the area of 135,500 hectares.",
  "14. Tadoba National Park: Located in Chandra Pur district of Maharashtra state of India, this",
  "National Park was notified in the year 1955. It is spread in an area of 11, 655 hectares and it supports",
  "the  populations  of  tiger,  sambhar,  sloth  beer,  lion,  chital,  chinkara,  barking  deer,  blue  bull,  four",
  "horned deer, langur, pea foul and crocodile.",
  "4.5.2. Wildlife Sanctuaries And Biosphere Reserves",
  "A. WILDLIFE SANCTUARY",
  "A Sanctuary is a protected area where wild animals and birds are kept and encouraged to",
  "increase their population. Presently, there are more than 490 sanctuaries in India covering a total area",
  "of 1, 48,848 sq km.",
  "In wildlife sanctuaries, rare and endangered species are encouraged to breed in human",
  "controlled environments with restricted settings. This is called as captive breeding. This is a",
  "successful technique to increase the populations of rare and endangered species of animals. When the",
  "populations of such animals are increased through captive breeding in the captivity the animals are",
  "safely released into the wild.",
  "The technique of captive breeding has following advantages \u2013",
  "1. It helps to increase the populations of rare and endangered species of animals and to save",
  "these animals from extinction.",
  "2. The birth rates, hatching rates and survival rates of captivity \u2013produced animals remains much",
  "higher than in case of higher bleedings.",
  "3. This technique helps us to raise the population of wild animals up to the desired levels.",
  "4. This technique is useful in developing desired characters or traits in organisms.",
  "Some important wildlife sanctuaries are being introduced here in Table 4.2.",
  "Table 4.2. Some important wildlife sanctuaries in IndiaThere are following differences between a National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary1. The boundaries of a National Park are usually well marked and circumscribed where as",
  "those of sanctuaries are often not well defined.",
  "2. A National Park is established under the provisions of Section 35, section 38(2), and",
  "Section 66(3) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972. On the other hand a Wildlife",
  "Sanctuary is an area that is established under the provisions of Section 26-A, Section",
  "38(1), and Section 66(3) of this Act.",
  "3. An area can not be notified as a National Park, if it is a reserve Forest. However this is not",
  "the case with a Wildlife Sanctuary in which an area can directly be notified as a Wildlife",
  "Sanctuary even if it is a reserve forest.",
  "4. As defined by IUCN (1975), a National Park is a large area of land containing ecosystems",
  "that have not been materially altered by human activities, and including plant and animal",
  "species, landscape  features,  and  habitat  of  great  scientific  interest,  or  of  beauty,  or",
  "recreational or educational interest; and the public is allowed to visit it for inspirational,",
  "cultural, and recreational purposes. On the other hand an Area set aside by the state to",
  "protect  characteristic  wildlife,  especially  migratory  bird  communities,  or  to  protect",
  "threatened animal or plant species etc. is called as a Wildlife Sanctuary. All forms of",
  "hunting,  killing  or  capturing  of  wildlife  are  prohibited  except  for  scientific  research",
  "authorized by the minister.",
  "5. A national Park is established by the government in view of protection of all the flora and",
  "fauna of certain area. But a Wildlife sanctuary is meant for the protection, breeding and",
  "propagation of individuals of an endangered species.",
  "In spite of some differences, National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries have basic similarities. It",
  "can be said that both the National Park and the Wildlife Sanctuary are protected areas, and no biotic",
  "interference is allowed in both of these areas. Both of these protected areas are established in India",
  "under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972. Both of these are small forest reserves",
  "ranging on an average to the area of 100 sq Km to 500 sq Km.",
  "B. BIOSPHERE RESERVES",
  "A specified area in which multiple use of land is allowed by dividing it into different zones",
  "and  each  zone,  of  which  remains  specified  for  a  particular  activity,  is  called  as  Biosphere",
  "Reserve.",
  "A  number  of  biosphere  reserves  have  been  established  by  United  Nations  Educational",
  "Scientific  and  Cultural  organisation  (UNESCO)  under  its  Man  And  Biosphere  Programme",
  "(MAB)-1986 in different countries. The biosphere reserves have international networks.",
  "Each of the biosphere reserve has been divided into three zones-",
  "(a) Core Zone, where human interference is banned completely.",
  "(b) Buffer Zones, where human interference is allowed up to limited extent.",
  "(c) Manipulated Zone or Transition Zones, where humans are free to perform their activities.",
  "The  biosphere  reserves  are  planned,  managed  and  protected  through  joint  efforts  of  the",
  "government, non- governmental organizations and the local people.",
  "India has declared 14 areas as biosphere reserves. These areas are aimed at \u2013",
  "(i) Conservation of biodiversity (species, ecosystem, and landscapes).",
  "(ii) Development of economic and human infrastructures.(iii) Promotion of education, information \u2013 exchange and research pertaining to conservation",
  "and development.",
  "The Biosphere Reserves have following functions-",
  "1. The biosphere reserves are helpful in the conservation of ecosystems, species and other",
  "resources.",
  "2. The biosphere reserves are helpful in the promotion of economic development.",
  "3. Biosphere reserves are helpful in promoting scientific research and education.",
  "Wet lands are habitats for a large number of species of plants and animals. What are wet lands?",
  "Well, these are areas where the water table is just beneath or at the land surface. In wet lands, the",
  "land is covered by shallow water. These lands play important roles in the regulation of water. In",
  "India, about 18 percent of land is covered by wet lands but most of them are under cultivation of",
  "paddy crop. The Indian Government has enacted laws for the preservation of wet lands and protection",
  "of wildlife.",
  "Being inspired by the importance of wet lands, the world community came down to develop",
  "Convention on Wetlands of international importance. The Ramsar Convention on the conservation",
  "and Management of Wetlands was held in on February 2, 1971 in the Iranian city Ramsar, which",
  "provided a framework for national actions and international co- operation on this issue. February 2,",
  "is celebrated as the \u201cWorld Wetland Day\u201d across the globe.",
  "4.5.3. Breeding Programmes for Endangered Species",
  "In India, efforts are underway to address the problem of species loss and extinction. Seriously",
  "threatened wild animals are being bred in captivity. When their population increases, animals are",
  "released to go in the wild and to live freely. It is through captive breeding that the population of",
  "Hawaiian goose or nene has increased over 2500.",
  "India has a goal of covering one third of its land area with existing or planted vegetation. It has",
  "achieved tremendous success in species conservation through its breeding programmes. The Project",
  "Tiger and Crocodile Breeding and Management Project are two world renowned programmes of",
  "increasing the populations of tigers and crocodiles respectively. Some of the principal aims of these",
  "projects  are  conservation  and  management  of  these  animals,  raising  their  population  and",
  "maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.",
  "Under Project Tiger, 9 special Tiger Reserves covering an area of 37761 sq km have been",
  "established for breeding and increasing the population of tigers. Corbett National Park, Bandhav Garh",
  "National Park, Kanha National Park, Sundarbans National Park are some major reserves under this",
  "project. Due to this, the population of tigers in the country doubled by 1989. The Project Tiger was",
  "launched during the period of 1973-74. WWF offers technical and financial assistance to the project.",
  "Another  ambitious  project  which  aims  at  long  term  survival  of  the  existing  population  of",
  "elephants is the Project Elephant. This project was started in the year 1992 in 12 states of India.",
  "4.5.4. Prevention of Poaching, Hunting and Bio- Piracy",
  "Poaching, Hunting and Bio- piracy are terms that relate to gradual extinction and destruction of",
  "our biotic resources due to human activities, usually oriented towards commercial benefits. However,",
  "these terms are very much different in their meanings from each other. So, let us discuss these terms",
  "separately.A. POACHING",
  "According to law, shooting, trapping or taking of game or fish from private property or",
  "from an area where such practices are especially reserved is called as Poaching. In other words,",
  "poaching is an illegal practice of hunting and killing of game or fish, for food and commercial",
  "benefits. But, what is the game? Well, wild animals, birds or fish, that are hunted for sporting and",
  "getting their flesh, is called as GAME. Game is the term, often applied to edible portion of wild",
  "animals (poultry, wild birds and mammals) also.",
  "B. HUNTING",
  "The practice of chasing and killing wild animals and birds as a sport or for food is called",
  "as hunting.",
  "In 17th and 18th centuries laws were passed to restrict the right of hunting to landlords, kings and",
  "their sons. Due to this, illegal hunting in the legally forbidden areas was started by gangs of organised",
  "hunters or poachers who used to hunt by breaking the law. Poaching is a profession similar to that of",
  "a thief but unlike the profession of a thief, the profession of a poacher involves chasing, deceiving and",
  "capturing a wild animal, killing it or cutting out its body parts for trade, without letting any one ( govt.",
  "or  any  law  enforcement  agency  )  know  about  his  activities.  Now  that  hunting  has  been  banned",
  "altogether, the illegal hunting i.e. poaching is going on almost in every part of the world for illegally",
  "gaining big commercial benefits.",
  "enviro _Facts : 04",
  "CITES or Convention on International Trade in Endangered species have framed International Laws to be applicable world",
  "wide. These laws protect endangered species and limit the illicit trade in wildlife, in their body parts and in the products derived by",
  "killing them across the world. This convention was drawn by the United Nations in 1973 and it came into force in 1975 when 18",
  "nations of the world including the United Nations, signed an agreement to co- operate in the enforcement of laws framed by CITES",
  "for the international safeguard of wildlife. By January 1, 1998, 143 nations of the world had become members of this",
  "international  organisation.  The  CITES  is  concerned  with  the  international  co-  operation  to  control  only  the  illegal  trade  in",
  "endangered species where as the TRAFFIC is concerned with the monitoring of both the legal as well as the illegal trade in",
  "wildlife across the world.",
  "On international level, the IUCN and the WWF established Trade Records Analysis of Flora and",
  "Fauna  in  International  Commerce  (TRAFFIC)  in  1976.  The  secretariat  of  the  TRAFFIC  has",
  "strengthened the efforts of the International Community to monitor and control illegal trade in wildlife",
  "and in their body parts. On the National Level we have different laws that are in force to check",
  "poaching and hunting of animals and also to check trade in their body parts. The Convention on",
  "International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of wild flora and fauna, the Interpol, World",
  "Custom Organisations and a large number of organisations on global level, are establishing networks",
  "to check the international trade in animals and in their body parts or in their products derived by",
  "killing them mercilessly.",
  "C. BIOPIRACY",
  "The illegal collection and patenting of the biological materials originally belonging to some",
  "other community, state or nation; is called as the bio-piracy. The Patenting is the act of gaining an",
  "official right of ownership. By patenting any thing or any biological material, a person, a corporation,",
  "a research institution or a country gains the officially legal authority of being the only owner of thatthing or the biological material.",
  "The term Bio-piracy relates to-",
  "(a) illegal unauthorised use of biological material like plants, animals or their products,",
  "(b) illegal and unauthorised use of traditional knowledge of some other society or community",
  "about the application of certain biological product(s),",
  "(c) unlawful  sharing  in  the  benefits  by  the  patent  holder  and  deprivation  of  indigenous",
  "communities or people who are the real owner of the biological material / knowledge used",
  "for making benefits.",
  "4.5.5. ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS",
  "The Article 48-A of the Indian Constitution directs;",
  "\u201cThe State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests",
  "and wildlife of the country.\u201d",
  "Further, Article 51\u2013A (g) of the Indian Constitution has imposed the duty on Indian citizens-",
  "\u201cto protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and",
  "to have compassion for living creatures.\u201d",
  "Thus, the Indian Constitution has laid a joint responsibility on both the state and every citizen of",
  "India to protect the natural environment and to check its deterioration.",
  "Earlier legislations of most of the countries were environmentally blind, probably because, the",
  "ill effects of the environmental problems had never been felt so deeply. The first cases to attract the",
  "attention of people of India towards animals were \u201cCruelty to Animals\u201d, and the \u201cneed of protecting",
  "wild elephants\u201d. In order to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering on animals and for",
  "that purpose to amend the law relating to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals an act was passed on",
  "December 26, 1960 by the Indian Parliament.",
  "(1) This Act is called as the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act- 1960.",
  "(2) It extends to the whole of India, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.",
  "It has been stated in the act that- It shall be the duty of every person having the care or",
  "charge of any animal to take all reasonable measures to ensure the well-being of such animal and",
  "to prevent the infliction upon such animal of unnecessary pain or suffering",
  "This act bans all types of atrocities often done by human beings on animals. How ever, it was",
  "thought that the act was ineffective in certain cases. Hence it was amended in 1982. According to the",
  "amendment; it shall be the duty of every person having the care or charge of any animal to take all",
  "reasonable measures to ensure the well being of such animal and to prevent the infliction upon such",
  "animal of unnecessary pain or suffering. In pursuance to this act, some norms for transporting animals",
  "from place to place without hurting them have also been laid down. In this spirit, an amendment was",
  "made in this act in 2004, in it\u2019s Section 38 to ensure safe and comfortable transport of animals. . So",
  "far,  the  government  of  India  has  formulated  about  200  laws  including  their  amendments,  for  the",
  "protection  of  wildlife.  The  other  act  is  the  Wildlife  Protection  Act-  1972.  Following  are  the",
  "objectives of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 \u2013 (also see enviro_Facts: 16.2.)",
  "1. The protection and preservation of different species of plants,",
  "2. Ban on the hunting of wildlife and the organisation of Wildlife Authority,",
  "3. Declaration and organisation of wildlife parks, protected areas, bio- reserves, wildlife",
  "sanctuaries, zoos and Central Zoo Authority of India,",
  "4. Penalties for violations of directives and legal provisions,5. Breeding and management of wildlife in captivities.",

  "TOWARDS A BETTER ENVIRONMENT\u2026",
  "The monitoring and management of endangered species has been made easier by the application of microchips. Today a tiny",
  "microchip bearing address of a particular animal is hiddenly implanted in the body of an animal. In case of piracy, the animal can be",
  "recovered and re- established in its original habitat as it can be traced by establishing a connection with the microchip. Microchips are",
  "being used by veterinarians also, for the identification of individual endangered animal. Earlier, the microchip technology was used in",
  "the management of captive breeding programmes only. But now, experts are using this technology to mark wild animals to mark",
  "inconspicuously.",
