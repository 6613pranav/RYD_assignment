  "Immediate Challenges\u2014territorial and administrative",
  "integration of princely states, communal riots, rehabilitation",
  "of nearly 60 lakh refugees migrated from Pakistan, protection",
  "of Muslims living in India as well as those going to Pakistan",
  "from  communal  gangs,  need  to  avoid  war  with  Pakistan,",

  "Medium  Term  Challenges\u2014framing  of  the",

  "Long  Term  Challenges\u2014national  integration,",
  "economic  development,  poverty  alleviation,  etc.",
  "India, as well as Pakistan, faced the consequences of",
  "partition. The Independence Act had laid the procedure for",
  "the resolution of three major problems\u2014(i) the settlement",
  "of boundaries between the two nations; (ii) the division of",
  "apparatus and personnel of Indian Civil Services and some",
  "other  services;  and  (iii)  division  of  military  assets  and",
  "formations.",
  "Radcliffe\u2019s  Boundary  Award  and",
  "the  Communal  Riots",
  "In accordance with the partition plan, the respective legislative",
  "assemblies of Punjab and Bengal met in two sections (one",
  "representing the Muslim majority districts and other of theChallenges Before the New-born Nation  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 593",
  "rest of the province) and decided by simple majority in favour",
  "of the partition of the two provinces. West Punjab which went",
  "to  Pakistan  received  62,000  square  miles  of  territory  and",
  "15.7 million people (census 1941), of whom 11.85 million",
  "were Muslims. East Punjab (India\u2019s share) received 37,000",
  "square miles of land area, with a population of 12.6 million,",
  "of whom 4.37 million were Muslims. Likewise, West Bengal",
  "became part of India with a territory of 28,000 square miles,",
  "and a population of 21.2 million, of whom 5.3 million were",
  "Muslims. East Bengal, which constituted East Pakistan, got",
  "49,400 square miles of territory and 39.10 million people",
  "(27.7 million Muslims and the rest non-Muslims). Thus on",
  "both sides of the Radcliffe Line, sizable sections of populations",
  "became  minority  (religion-wise)\u201420  million  non-Muslims",
  "in  Pakistan  and  42  million  (later  reduced  to  35  million)",
  "Muslims in India.",
  "Challenges before the Boundary",
  "Commission",
  "In absurd hurry, the British government appointed the Boundary",
  "Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Cyril Radcliffe.",
  "The Boundary Commission consisted of two Muslims and",
  "two  non-Muslim  judges  in  each  case,  and  worked  under",
  "serious constraints. Radcliffe, with very limited knowledge",
  "of India, and with the use of out-of-date maps and census",
  "materials, was required to draw the boundaries and decide",
  "disputed points within a period of six weeks.",
  "Although the religious demography was the deciding",
  "factor, other factors, such as rivers as natural boundaries,",
  "administrative units, economic viability, railway and roadway",
  "connectivity and other infrastructural facilities, such as the",
  "canal system, were also to be taken into consideration. The",
  "Sikhs,  as  a  third  party  (Hindus  and  Muslims  being  two",
  "parties), were demographically scattered throughout Punjab.",
  "Their demand that all Sikh holy shrines be included in East",
  "Punjab (part of India) further complicated the situation. In",
  "face of such legal intricacies, a rational approach gave way",
  "to political considerations. The census of 1941, the basis of",
  "decisions, was also faulty. So the resultant boundary lines",
  "were bound to create several problems and leave many people",
  "unhappy.594 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "The report of the Boundary Commission was ready by",
  "August  12,  but  Lord  Mountbatten  intentionally  made  it",
  "public  after  August  15,  so  that  the  responsibility  of  the",
  "consequences\u2014communal riots and its repercussions\u2014would",
  "not fall on the British.",
  "The way in which the British government decided to",
  "demarcate the boundary and leave the country amidst unrest",
  "was a most callous way to behave.",
  "Regions Most Affected by Riots",
  "The communal riots had started in August 1946 itself, but",
  "with the announcement of partition and independence, the",
  "situation became more inflamed. The regions through which",
  "the  Radcliffe  line  was  drawn  became  most  violent  and",
  "maximum number of murders, rapes and abduction of women",
  "and children took place. Armed bands of Sikhs (and Hindus)",
  "and Muslims roamed the cities and countryside of Punjab,",
  "committing  unbelievable  crimes.",
  "A war of extermination was launched on both sides of",
  "the border, when refugee trains are reported to have arrived",
  "sometimes  carrying  only  dead  bodies.  According  to  an",
  "estimate, around 180,000 were killed (60,000 from the west",
  "and  120,000  from  the  east).",
  "The regions of Bengal, due to the presence of Gandhi",
  "and his efforts through fasts, experienced less violence in",
  "comparison  to  Punjab.",
  "Riots began in Delhi, with a massacre of Muslims in",
  "revenge for Punjab (Gandhian fasts had a temporary impact).",
  "In Bihar, prior to partition, in October 1946, Hindu",
  "peasants, allegedly instigated by Hindu landlords to divert",
  "attention from agrarian problems, killed Muslims. This was",
  "followed by violence in Garhmukteswar in the United Province",
  "where  Hindu  pilgrims  killed  thousand  Muslims.  But  after",
  "partition, due to Gandhi\u2019s initiatives, no massacres took place",
  "in  these  regions.",
  "Why  so  many  casualties  The  governor-general",
  "anticipated  the  danger  of  riots  and  assembled  a  boundary",
  "force  of  50,000  men.  But  Nehru\u2019s  decision  to  not  allow",
  "British troops into the matter proved devastating\u2014the boundary",
  "force  themselves  got  divided  along  communal  affiliations.",
  "Further, the European officers were busy preparing to leave",
  "India. According to Lockhart, the Commander-in-Chief of theChallenges Before the New-born Nation  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 595",
  "Views",
  "The systematic failure of British governments to contemplate or",
  "prepare for any planned transfer of power to India is epitomised",
  "by the fact that a man of Radcliffe\u2019s background and lack of",
  "experience (he had never been east of Gibraltar before he came",
  "to  India)  should  have  been  asked  to  embark  on  such  a",
  "fundamental task so very late in the day.",
  "\u2014Walter Reid, Keeping the Jewel in the Crown",
  "With limitations of time, knowledge and understanding, it was",
  "virtually  impossible  to  deal  adequately  with  the  often  vital",
  "accessories of a boundary line\u2014such as the location of the canal",
  "head waters in relation to the canals themselves, communications",
  "by road and rail, the fate of mixed or isolated populations and",
  "such \u2018invisible\u2019 problems as the location of pasture lands in",
  "relation to villagers\u2019 flocks and herds.",
  "\u2014Percival Spear",
  "He (Radcliffe) tried to take account of irrigation canals and water",
  "supplies so that there was enough water in the central Punjab,",
  "but on the scale with which he was dealing, he was bound to",
  "make mistakes. If villages weren\u2019t bisected by the boundary they",
  "were separated from the villagers\u2019 fields, railway stations from",
  "the towns they served and communities from the resources on",
  "which they relied.",
  "Walter Reid, Keeping the Jewel in the Crown",
  "They had absolutely no conception. They asked me to come",
  "in and do this sticky job for them, and when I had done it they",
  "hated it. But what could they expect in the circumstances?",
  "Surely, they must have realised what was coming to them once",
  "they had decided on partition. But they had made absolutely",
  "no plans for coping with the situation.",
  "\u2014Radcliffe, quoted by Leonard Mosley,",
  "The Last Days of the British Raj",
  "Indian Army (August 15\u2013December 31, 1947), the widespread",
  "disorder would have been under control if all the personnel",
  "from  civil  and  armed  services  had  been  placed  in  their",
  "respective  new  countries.",
  "Challenges  Associated  with",
  "Division  of  Resources",
  "The  partition  of  India  was  accompanied  by  division  of",
  "resources of the civil government as well as division of the",
  "military  forces  and  equipment.596 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  " Division of Civil Government",
  "To  resolve  the  division  of  civil  government  amicably,  a",
  "partition council, presided over by the governor-general and",
  "consisting of two representatives each of India and Pakistan,",
  "was set up. The council was helped by a steering committee,",
  "consisting of H.M. Patel and Mohammad Ali, at operational",
  "level. All civl servants were offered to give their option about",
  "the  Dominion  they  wanted  to  serve.  Around  1,60,000",
  "employees opted for transfer from India to Pakistan or from",
  "Pakistan to India.",
  "For  the  personnel  of  the  Indian  Civil  Services,  a",
  "distinction was made between the Europeans and the Indians.",
  "The  Indian  members  were  to  continue  in  service  in  their",
  "country of choice (India or Pakistan) on the existing scale",
  "of service. The European officers could continue in service",
  "on their existing pay, leave, pension rights, etc., but if they",
  "wished to retire they were entitled to special compensation",
  "and  early  retirement.",
  " Division of Finances",
  "The division of cash balances as well as allocation of public",
  "debt  created  tensions  between  the  two  countries.  Pakistan",
  "wanted a one-fourth share of the total cash balances, but India",
  "had to point out that only a small portion of the cash balances",
  "represented the real cash needs of the undivided India and",
  "the rest was maintained only as an anti-inflationary mechanism.",
  "Ramachandra Guha writes in his India After Gandhi that the",
  "Indian  government  had  withheld  Pakistan\u2019s  share  of  the",
  "\u2018sterling balance\u2019 which the British owed jointly to the two",
  "dominions, a debt incurred on account of Indian contributions",
  "to the Second World War. The amount was some Rs 550",
  "million. The Indian government was not keen to release the",
  "money due to Pakistan as it was angry with Pakistan for",
  "having attempted to seize Kashmir by force. Gandhi saw this",
  "as being unnecessarily spiteful. He went on a fast and made",
  "the  ending  of  the  fast  conditional  on  the  transfer  of  the",
  "money owed to Pakistan. He succeeded in pressurising the",
  "Congress leadership to decide to give more cash resources",
  "to Pakistan. (According to some scholars, this became one",
  "of the reasons for the assassination of Gandhi by a Hindu",
  "fanatic).Challenges Before the New-born Nation  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 597",
  " Division of Defence Personnel and",
  "Equipment",
  "For a smooth division of the armed forces and their plants,",
  "machinery,  equipment  and  stores,  a  joint  defence  council,",
  "headed by Auchinleck as its Supreme Commander, was set",
  "up. The council decided that Muslim-majority units should",
  "be transferred to Pakistan and non-Muslim units to India, but",
  "due to serious differences between the two parties, the post",
  "of  Supreme  Commander  was  abolished.  Amidst  serious",
  "chaos, the British troops started to leave India from August",
  "17, 1947 and the process was completed by February 1948.",
  "Assassination  of  Gandhi",
  "On the evening of January 30, 1948, as he carried on his",
  "usual prayer meeting at Birla mansion (New Delhi), Mahatma",
  "Gandhi was shot dead by Nathuram Godse. The event sent",
  "shock waves through the nation in making. Communalism and",
  "misinterpretation of nationalism were two fundamental factors",
  "under whose influence Godse killed Gandhi.",
  "In an address to the nation on the All India Radio, Nehru",
  "summed up the mood and spirit of the time, \u201cThe light has",
  "gone out of our lives and there is darkness everywhere\u2026",
  "The best prayer we can offer him and his memory is to",
  "dedicate ourselves to truth and to the cause for which the",
  "great countryman of ours lived and for which he died.\u201d",
  "Sardar Patel appealed to the people not to seek revenge",
  "but to follow Gandhi\u2019s message of love and non-violence.",
  "He said, \u201cIt is a shame for us that the greatest man of the",
  "world has had to pay with his life for the sins which we have",
  "committed. We did not follow him when he was alive; let",
  "us at least follow his steps now he is dead.\u201d",
  "Nathuram Godse was tried and sentenced to death. At",
  "his trial he declared that he had acted as he had because of",
  "Gandhi\u2019s consistent pandering to the Muslims, \u201cculminating",
  "in his last pro-Muslim fast [which] at last goaded me to the",
  "conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought",
  "to an end immediately.\u201d",
  "On February 4, 1948, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh",
  "(RSS) was banned by the government. It was felt by the598 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "government that the right wing extremism which the RSS was",
  "seen to represent would be very harmful for the unity of the",
  "nation. Though not directly involved in the assassination of",
  "Gandhi, the organisation was seen to have a hand in the Punjab",
  "violence.  It  also  attracted  the  support  of  many  of  the",
  "refugees. It was also rumoured that the members of the RSS",
  "had celebrated the death of Gandhi. Nehru considered that",
  "groups such as the RSS had \u201cthe blood of Mahatma Gandhi",
  "on their hands\u201d even though they dissociated themselves from",
  "his killing. The ban was lifted in July 1949, when the RSS",
  "accepted the conditions laid down by the government. These",
  "conditions were that the Sangh would restrict itself to cultural",
  "activities and not meddle with politics; renounce its agenda",
  "of violence and secrecy; profess publicly loyalty to the Indian",
  "Constitution  and  flag  (tri-colour);  and  organise  itself  on",
  "democratic  principles.",
  "Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement",
  "of  Refugees",
  "The people displaced by partition were \u2018refugees\u2019 in the sense",
  "that they had not left their homes voluntarily. The two new",
  "governments  did  not  organise  an  orderly  exchange  of",
  "population.  Refugee  resettlement  became  the  immediate",
  "challenge  for  both  governments  (India  and  Pakistan).  The",
  "Indian government established an emergency committee of",
  "the cabinet to deal with the crisis in Delhi, and a Ministry",
  "of Relief and Rehabilitation to look after the refugees. In",
  "view of large-scale influx of displaced people, the notion of",
  "\u2018evacuee property\u2019 to be protected by government, for any",
  "future return of those who had left for Pakistan, became an",
  "empty  rhetoric  because  it  was  almost  impossible  to  force",
  "the refugees who settled in the empty houses of Muslims.",
  "(This,  at  a  later  time,  made  the  return  of  the  refugees",
  "impossible).",
  " East Punjab",
  "Some refugees were accommodated temporarily in refugee",
  "camps, which were run till 1949. For urban refugees, the",
  "government started industrial and vocational training schemes,Challenges Before the New-born Nation  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 599",
  "and  even  grants  were  given  to  start  small  businesses  or",
  "industries. The rural refugees were given land, agricultural",
  "loans and housing subsidies. Although, the state government",
  "and the central government mobilised massive resources, it",
  "was still not adequate and a general trend of differentiated",
  "entitlements  to  such  benefits  was  observed.  For  example",
  "refugees  with  social  and  cultural  capital\u2014class  and  caste",
  "status and political connections\u2014often got the better deal,",
  "while  the  depressed  classes  were  given  little  or  no",
  "consideration.",
  " Bengal",
  "The problem was much more prolonged and complicated in",
  "Bengal. By 1948, only a small group of high-caste, landed",
  "or middle class Hindus migrated to West Bengal by arranging",
  "exchange of property or jobs on individual levels. But during",
  "December 1949 and January 1950, due to a fresh outbreak",
  "of violence in Khulna, a large number of peasants started to",
  "leave East Pakistan. In revenge, anti-Muslim riots started in",
  "February  1950  and  forced  about  one  million  Muslims  to",
  "leave West Bengal. This further aggravated anti-Hindu violence",
  "in East Pakistan and by 1951, about 15 lakh Hindu refugees",
  "arrived in West Bengal. But the Indian government didn\u2019t",
  "recognise these migrants as refugees and Nehru tried to send",
  "them back.",
  " Delhi Pact on Minorities",
  "To resolve the problems of refugees and restore communal",
  "peace  in  the  two  countries,  especially  in  Bengal  (East",
  "Pakistan as well as West Bengal), the Indian prime minister,",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pakistani prime minister, Liaquat",
  "Ali  Khan,  signed  an  agreement  on  April  8,  1950.  The",
  "agreement, known as the Delhi Pact on Minorities or Liaquat-",
  "Nehru  Pact,  envisaged  the  appointment  of  ministers  from",
  "minority  communities  in  both  Pakistan  and  India  at  both",
  "central  and  provincial  levels.  Under  the  pact,  minority",
  "commissions were to be set up, together with the Commissions",
  "of  Inquiry  to  look  into  the  probable  causes  behind  the",
  "communal riots on both sides of border (in Bengal), and to",
  "recommend  steps  to  prevent  recurrence  of  such  incidents.",
  "Under the pact, India and Pakistan also agreed to include600 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "representatives  of  the  minority  community  in  the  cabinets",
  "of East Pakistan and West Bengal and decided to depute two",
  "central ministers, one from each government, to remain in",
  "the affected regions for such period as might be necessary.",
  "The  pact  provided  for  the  creation  of  an  agency",
  "entrusted  with  the  task  of  recovering  and  rehabilitating",
  "\u2018abducted\u2019 women (the idea was criticised by many scholars).",
  "The idea to encourage refugees to return to their original",
  "homes failed, because the two governments failed to restore",
  "confidence  among  the  refugees.  Further,  the  properties  of",
  "the refugees were declared as enemy property [India brought",
  "amendments in the Enemy Property Act, 1968 in 2016 also].",
  "The provisions of the Liaquat-Nehru Pact were severely",
  "criticised  by  Hindu  nationalists  like  Shyama  Prasad",
  "Mookherjee and K.C. Neogy. Mookherjee resigned from the",
  "Nehru  cabinet  in  protest,  as  he  believed  that  the  refugee",
  "problem could only be solved through a transfer of population",
  "and  acquisition  of  certain  territories  from  Pakistan  to",
  "rehabilitate the people who came into India.",
  "Centres of Refugee Settlements in India",
  "In  Delhi,  Lajpat  Nagar,  Rajinder  Nagar,  Punjabi  Bagh,",
  "Nizamuddin  East  and  Kingsway  Camp  were  some  areas",
  "developed  into  housing  complexes  to  settle  the  refugees",
  "permanently. People who came from West Pakistan settled",
  "in states like Punjab (which at the time included the present",
  "day  Haryana)  and  Himachal  Pradesh.  The  Sindhi  Hindus",
  "settled in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.",
  "Ulhasnagar  (city  of  joy),  in  Maharashtra,  was  especially",
  "developed  to  settle  refugees  from  Sindh  areas.",
  "West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and other north-eastern",
  "states accommodated the refugees from East Pakistan (present",
  "Bangladesh). The government settled some refugees in the",
  "Andaman Islands too (at present, Bengalis form the largest",
  "linguistic group in some parts of Andaman Islands).",
  "Communists  and  Independence",
  "On September 1948, on the pretext of maintaining law and",
  "order situation in South India, the Indian army intervened and",
  "took control of Hyderabad without much resistance from theChallenges Before the New-born Nation  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 601",
  "Nizam.  But  the  internal  politics  of  Hyderabad  became",
  "complicated  due  to  the  Telangana  movement  led  by  the",
  "communists.  The  alliance  between  the  Congress  and  the",
  "communists had broken before the accession of Hyderabad",
  "into India.",
  "In December 1947, the Communist Party of India (CPI)",
  "had denounced the Indian independence as \u2018fake\u2019\u2014with the",
  "slogan,  \u2018ye  azadi  jhooti  hai\u2019\u2014and  termed  the  Congress",
  "government led by Nehru as the stooges of Anglo-American",
  "imperialism  and  the  feudal  forces  within  the  country.  In",
  "February-March 1948, in its Second Congress in Calcutta,",
  "the CPI adopted its \u2018Political Thesis\u2019, which formally declared",
  "that the national government established on August 15, 1947",
  "was indeed the major enemy of the Indian people and hence",
  "required to be changed through general revolution. To achieve",
  "this  goal,  the  communist  leaders  decided  to  follow  what",
  "popularly came to be known as the B.T. Ranadive line (after",
  "the name of CPI\u2019s then general secretary). They declared,",
  "\u201cthe present state will be replaced by a people\u2019s democratic",
  "republic\u2014a  republic  of  workers,  peasants  and  oppressed",
  "middle classes.\u201d The Communist insurgency spread to other",
  "parts of India especially in West Bengal which saw the revival",
  "of  the  Tebhaga  Movement  and  an  urban  insurgency  in",
  "Calcutta.",
  "Why Communists were Sceptical about",
  "Independence?",
  "1. They believed that a policy of class struggle and",

  "communal hatred that shrouded the country after partition.",
  "2.  The  late  1940s  and  the  early  1950s  witnessed",
  "communist successes in Asian countries like China, Malaya,",
  "Indonesia, the Philippines and Burma (Myanmar). In September",
  "1947, Russia announced its \u2018A. Zhdanov thesis\u2019 as an answer",
  "to the Marshall Plan, encouraging more activism on the part",
  "of the international communist parties. The Indian communists",
  "thus geared up for an armed insurgency.602 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "3. According to Ramachandra Guha, the CPI leadership,",
  "encouraged  by  the  initial  successes  of  the  Telangana",
  "movement, misconceived the \u2018scattered disillusionment with",
  "the Congress as revolutionary potential, and thought this as",
  "the \u2018beginning of Red India\u2019.",
  "Shift from Antagonistic Strategy to",

  "The communist movement remained localised in Hyderabad",
  "and  West  Bengal.  The  mass  support  was  sporadic  and",
  "conditional as people were not ready to reject the Congress",
  "so soon after Independence. The government also decided to",
  "take stern action; while in the Hyderabad region the Indian",
  "armed forces continued its \u2018police action\u2019, in West Bengal",
  "the CPI was banned in March 1948 and in January, a security",
  "act was passed to imprison the communist leaders without",
  "trial. Within the Communist leadership, there were divisions",
  "on the \u2018Chinese line\u2019 and the \u2018Russian line\u2019 which became",
  "wider after the failure of a proposed railway strike on May",
  "9,  1949.",
  "In September 1950, the prominent communist leaders",
  "like Ajoy Ghosh, S.A. Dange and S.V. Ghate criticised the",
  "organisation for its faulty strategies and its failure to take",
  "notice of the true picture of independent India. Consequently,",
  "in October 1951, at the Third Party Congress of the CPI,",
  "held in Calcutta, a significant shift in its policy was endorsed.",
  "It decided to withdraw the Telangana movement and forge",
  "an  inclusive  front  of  the  peasants,  workers  and  middle",
  "classes. Consequently, the ban was lifted by the government,",
  "and the Indian communists participated in the general election",
  "of 1951-52, thus moving from an insurrectionist path to the",
  "path  of  constitutional  democracy.",
