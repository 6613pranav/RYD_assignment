  "Features",
  "Factors  Giving  Rise  to",
  "Desire  for  Reform",
  "The dawn of the nineteenth century witnessed the birth of",
  "a  new  vision\u2014a  modern  vision  among  some  enlightened",
  "sections of the Indian society. This enlightened vision was",
  "to shape the course of events for decades to come and even",
  "beyond.  This  process  of  reawakening,  sometimes,  but  not",
  "with full justification, defined as the \u2018Renaissance\u2019, did not",
  "always  follow  the  intended  line  and  gave  rise  to  some",
  "undesirable by-products as well, which have become as much",
  "188Socio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 189",
  "a part of daily existence in the whole of the Indian subcontinent",
  "as have the fruits of these reform movements.",
  " Impact of British Rule",
  "The presence of a colonial government on Indian soil played",
  "a complex, yet decisive role in this crucial phase of modern",
  "Indian history. The impact of British rule on Indian society",
  "and culture was widely different from what India had known",
  "before. Most of the earlier invaders, who had come to India",
  "settled  within  its  frontiers,  were  either  absorbed  by  its",
  "superior  culture  or  interacted  positively  with  it  and  had",
  "become part of the land and its people. However, the British",
  "conquest was different. It came at a time when India, in",
  "contrast to an enlightened Europe of the eighteenth century",
  "affected in every aspect by science and scientific outlook,",
  "presented the picture of a stagnant civilisation and a static",
  "and decadent society.",
  " Social Conditions Ripe for Reform",
  "Religious  and  Social  Ills",
  "Indian  society  in  the  nineteenth  century  was  caught  in  a",
  "vicious  web  created  by  religious  superstitions  and  social",
  "obscurantism. Hinduism had become steeped in magic and",
  "superstition.  The  priests  exercised  an  overwhelming  and,",
  "indeed,  unhealthy  influence  on  the  minds  of  the  people.",
  "Idolatry and polytheism helped to reinforce their position,",
  "and  their  monopoly  of  scriptural  knowledge  imparted  a",
  "deceptive  character  to  all  religious  systems.  There  was",
  "nothing that religious ideology could not persuade people to",
  "do.",
  "Depressing  Position  of  Women",
  "Social  conditions  were  equally  depressing.  The  most",
  "distressing  was  the  position  of  women.  Attempts  to  kill",
  "female infants at birth were not unusual. Child marriage was",
  "another bane of society. The practice of polygamy prevailed",
  "and in Bengal, under Kulinism, even old men took very young",
  "girls as wives. Several women hardly had a married life worth",
  "the name, yet (at least among the higher castes) when their",
  "husbands died they were expected to commit sati which Raja190 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Rammohan Roy described as a \u201cmurder according to every",
  "shastra\u201d.  If  they  escaped  this  social  coercion,  they  were",
  "condemned to a life of misery and humiliation.",
  "The  Caste  Problem",
  "Another debilitating factor was caste. This entailed a system",
  "of segregation, hierarchically ordained on the basis of ritual",
  "status. At the bottom of the ladder came the untouchables",
  "or scheduled castes, as they came to be called later. The",
  "untouchables suffered from numerous and severe disabilities",
  "and restrictions. The system splintered people into numerous",
  "groups. In modern times it became a major obstacle in the",
  "growth  of  a  united  national  feeling  and  the  spread  of",
  "democracy. It may also be noted that caste consciousness,",
  "particularly with regard to marriage, prevailed also among",
  "Muslims,  Christians  and  Sikhs  who  also  practised",
  "untouchability, though in a less virulent form. Under a rigid",
  "caste system, social mobility was checked, social divisions",
  "grew, and individual initiative was thwarted. Above all, the",
  "humiliation of untouchability\u2014so much a part of the caste",
  "system\u2014militated against human dignity.",
  " Opposition to Western Culture",
  "The establishment of colonial rule in India was followed by",
  "a  systematic  attempt  to  disseminate  colonial  culture  and",
  "ideology as the dominant cultural current. Faced with the",
  "challenge of the intrusion of colonial culture and ideology,",
  "an  attempt  to  reinvigorate  traditional  institutions  and  to",
  "realise the potential of traditional culture developed during",
  "the  nineteenth  century.",
  " New Awareness among Enlightened",
  "Indians",
  "The impact of modern Western culture and consciousness",
  "of defeat by a foreign power gave birth to a new awakening.",
  "There was an awareness that a vast country like India had been",
  "colonised by a handful of foreigners because of weaknesses",
  "within the Indian social structure and culture. For some time",
  "it  seemed  that  India  had  lagged  behind  in  the  race  of",
  "civilisation. This produced diverse reactions. Some English-",
  "educated  Bengali  youth  developed  a  revulsion  for  HinduSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 191",
  "religion and culture, gave up old religious ideas and traditions",
  "and deliberately adopted practices most offensive to Hindu",
  "sentiments,  such  as  drinking  wine  and  eating  beef.  The",
  "response, indeed, was varied but the need to reform social",
  "and religious life was a commonly shared conviction.",
  "During the last decades of the nineteenth century, the",
  "rising tide of nationalism and democracy also found expression",
  "in  movements  to  reform  and  democratise  the  social",
  "institutions  and  religious  outlook  of  the  Indian  people.",
  "Factors such as growth of nationalist sentiments, emergence",
  "of  new  economic  forces,  spread  of  education,  impact  of",
  "modern Western ideas and culture and increased awareness",
  "of  the  world  strengthened  the  resolve  to  reform.",
  "The  socio-cultural  regeneration  of  the  India  of  the",
  "nineteenth century was occasioned by the colonial presence,",
  "but not created by it.",
  "Social  and  Ideological  Bases  of",
  "Reform",
  " Middle Class Base",
  "The social base of the regeneration seen in the nineteenth",
  "century  was  the  newly  emerging  middle  class  and  the",
  "educated (both traditionally educated and the Western educated)",
  "intellectuals, but there was a significant contrast between the",
  "broadly middle class ideals derived from a growing awareness",
  "of  contemporary  developments  in  the  West,  and  a",
  "predominantly  non-middle  class  social  base.",
  "The nineteenth century intelligentsia searched for its",
  "model in the European \u2018middle class\u2019, which, as it learnt",
  "through  Western  education,  had  brought  about  the  great",
  "transformation in the West from medieval to modern times",
  "through movements like the Renaissance, the Reformation,",
  "the  Enlightenment  and  democratic  revolution  or  reform.",
  "However, the intelligentsia of nineteenth century India did",
  "not grow from trade or industry (which were firmly under",
  "the control of British agencies); their roots lay in government",
  "service or the professions of law, education, journalism or192 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "medicine\u2014with which was often combined some connection",
  "with land in the form of the intermediate tenures.",
  " The Intellectual Criteria",
  "What gave these reform movements an ideological unity were",
  "rationalism, religious universalism and humanism. Rationalism",
  "was brought to judge social relevance. Raja Rammohan Roy",
  "firmly believed in the principle of causality linking the whole",
  "phenomenal universe and demonstrability as the sole criterion",
  "of truth. Akshay Kumar Dutt, while declaring that \u201crationalism",
  "is  our  only  preceptor\u201d,  held  that  all  natural  and  social",
  "phenomena  could  be  analysed  and  understood  by  purely",
  "mechanical processes. They thus used a rational approach to",
  "study  tradition;  they  evaluated  the  contemporary  socio-",
  "religious practices from the standpoint of social utility and",
  "to replace faith with rationality. As a consequence, in the",
  "Brahmo Samaj the infallibility of the Vedas was repudiated,",
  "while  the  Aligarh  movement  emphasised  reconciliation  of",
  "Islamic teachings with the needs of the modern age. Syed",
  "Ahmed Khan went to the extent of emphasising that religious",
  "tenets  were  not  immutable.",
  "Many  of  the  intellectuals  set  aside  the  authority  of",
  "religion and evaluated truth in any religion by the criteria",
  "of logic, reason or science. According to Swami Vivekananda,",
  "the same method of investigation which applies to sciences",
  "should  be  the  basis  on  which  religion  must  justify  itself.",
  "Although  some  reformers  tended  to  appeal  to  faith  and",
  "ancient authority to support their appeal, on the whole, a",
  "rational and secular outlook was very much evident in putting",
  "forward an alternative to prevalent social practices. Akshay",
  "Kumar Dutt, for instance, brought medical opinion to support",
  "his views against child marriage. Reference to the past was",
  "to be used only as an aid and an instrument. Neither a revival",
  "of the past nor a total break with tradition was envisaged.",
  "Though the reformers tried to reform their religions,",
  "there was a universalistic aspect to their religious perspective.",
  "Raja Rammohan Roy considered different religions as national",
  "embodiments of universal theism. He defended the basic and",
  "universal principles of all religions\u2014such as the monotheism",
  "of the Vedas and unitarianism of Christianity\u2014while attackingSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 193",
  "the polytheism of Hinduism and trinitarianism of Christianity.",
  "Syed Ahmed Khan said that all prophets had the same \u2018din\u2019",
  "(faith) and every country and nation had different prophets.",
  "The social reformers used the universalist perspective",
  "to contend with the influence of religious identity on the",
  "social and political outlook of the people which was indeed",
  "strong.",
  "A  new  humanitarian  morality  was  embodied  in  the",
  "social  reform  movements  which  included  the  notion  that",
  "humanity can progress and has progressed, and that moral",
  "values  are  ultimately  those  values  which  favour  human",
  "progress.  The  humanist  aspect  of  the  religious  reform",
  "movements was to be seen in the emphasis on the individual\u2019s",
  "right to interpret religious scriptures in the light of human",
  "reason and human welfare and in a general attack on priestly",
  "domination  of  religious  practices.",
  "Religious  reformation  was  an  important  but  not  the",
  "exclusive  concern  of  these  movements.  Attention  was",
  "focussed on worldly existence and not on issues of salvation",
  "or other worldliness. Because of the strong religious element",
  "in social practices and the fact that religion was the dominant",
  "ideology of the times, it was not possible to undertake any",
  "social action without coming to grips with it.",
  "These  movements  took  into  their  ambit  the  entire",
  "cultural  existence,  the  way  of  life.  The  evolution  of  an",
  "alternative cultural-ideological system and the regeneration",
  "of  traditional  institutions  were  two  concerns  of  these",
  "movements. These concerns were manifest in the attempts",
  "to reconstruct traditional knowledge, the use and development",
  "of vernacular languages, creation of an alternative system of",
  "education, defence of religion, efforts to regenerate Indian",
  "art and literature, the emphasis on Indian dress and food,",
  "attempts to revitalise the Indian systems of medicine and to",
  "research  the  pre-colonial  technology  for  its  potential.",
  " Two Streams",
  "The reform movements could broadly be classified into two",
  "categories\u2014the reformist movements like the Brahmo Samaj,",
  "the Prarthana Samaj, the Aligarh Movement, and the revivalist",
  "movements like Arya Samaj and the Deoband movement. The194 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "reformist as well as the revivalist movement depended, to",
  "varying degrees, on an appeal to the lost purity of the religion",
  "they  sought  to  reform.  The  only  difference  between  one",
  "reform movement and the other lay in the degree to which",
  "it  relied  on  tradition  or  on  reason  and  conscience.",
  "Direction  of  Social  Reform",
  "The humanistic ideals of social equality and the equal worth",
  "of all individuals which inspired the newly educated middle",
  "class influenced the field of social reform in a major way.",
  "The social reform movements were linked to the religious",
  "reforms  primarily  because  nearly  all  social  ills  like",
  "untouchability and gender-based inequity derived legitimacy",
  "from religion in one way or the other. In later years, though,",
  "the social reform movement gradually dissociated itself from",
  "religion and adopted a secular approach. Moreover, earlier",
  "the reform movements had a rather narrow social base, being",
  "limited to the upper and middle classes and upper castes who",
  "tried  to  balance  their  modernised  views  and  the  existing",
  "social conditions. But later on, the social reform movements",
  "penetrated the lower strata of society to revolutionise and",
  "reconstruct  the  social  sphere.",
  "In  the  beginning,  organisations  such  as  the  Social",
  "Conference,  Servants  of  India  Society  and  the  Christian",
  "missionaries were instrumental in social reform along with",
  "many enlightened individuals like Jyotiba Phule, Gopalhari",
  "Deshmukh,  K.T.  Telang,  B.M.  Malabari,  D.K.  Karve,  Sri",
  "Narayana Guru, E.V. Ramaswami Naicker and B.R. Ambedkar.",
  "In  later  years,  especially  with  the  onset  of  the  twentieth",
  "century, the national movement provided the leadership and",
  "organisation  for  social  reform.",
  "To  reach  the  masses,  the  reformers  used  the  Indian",
  "languages to propagate their views. They used a variety of",
  "media\u2014novels, dramas, poetry, short stories, the press and,",
  "in  the  1930s  and  later  on,  the  cinema\u2014to  spread  their",
  "opinions.",
  "Broadly, the social reform movements had a two-point",
  "agenda\u2014fight  for  the  betterment  of  status  of  women  inSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 195",
  "society  and  fight  to  remove  disabilities  arising  out  of",
  "untouchability.",
  " Fight for Betterment of Position",
  "of Women",
  "The reformers had to work against great odds. Women were",
  "generally accorded a low status and were considered to be",
  "inferior adjuncts to men, with no identity of their own. They",
  "enjoyed no scope of giving expression to their talents as they",
  "were suppressed by practices such as purdah, early marriage,",
  "ban on widow-marriage, sati, etc. Both Hindu and Muslim",
  "women were economically and socially dependent on male",
  "relatives, while education was generally denied to them. The",
  "Hindu women did not enjoy the right to inherit property or",
  "to terminate an undesirable marriage. Muslim women could",
  "inherit property but only half as much as men could, while",
  "in matters of divorce there was no equality between men and",
  "women. Polygamy was prevalent among Hindus as well as",
  "Muslims.",
  "Their glorification as wives and mothers was the only",
  "way in which society recognised the contribution of women",
  "as members of society. The improvement of the status of",
  "women in the society was considered to be vital, and social",
  "reformers worked towards this since a radical change in the",
  "domestic sphere\u2014where initial socialisation of the individual",
  "takes place and where a crucial role is played by women\u2014",
  "was the need of the hour. It was clearly understood that this",
  "change would translate into reformed homes and reformed",
  "men,  and  that  no  country  whose  females  were  sunk  in",
  "ignorance could ever make significant progress in civilisation.",
  "The  social  reform  movements,  the  freedom  struggle,",
  "movements led by enlightened women themselves and, later,",
  "free India\u2019s Constitution have done much for the emancipation",
  "of women.",
  "The reformers basically appealed to the doctrines of",
  "individualism and equality, and argued, to bolster their appeal,",
  "that true religion did not sanction an inferior status to women.",
  "They raised their voice against degrading customs such as",
  "polygamy,  purdah,  child  marriage,  restrictions  on  widow",
  "marriage,  and  worked  relentlessly  to  establish  educational196 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "facilities for women, to persuade the government to enact",
  "favourable legislations for women and in general to propagate",
  "the uselessness of medieval, feudal attitudes which required",
  "to be given up.",
  "Steps  taken  to  Ameliorate  Women\u2019s  Position",
  "Because  of  the  indefatigable  efforts  of  the  reformers,  a",
  "number  of  administrative  measures  were  adopted  by  the",
  "government to improve the condition of women.",
  "Abolition  of  Sati  Influenced  by  the  frontal  attack",
  "launched by the enlightened Indian reformers led by Raja",
  "Rammohan Roy, the government declared the practice of sati",
  "illegal and punishable by criminal courts as culpable homicide.",
  "The regulation of 1829 (Regulation XVII, A.D. 1829 of the",
  "Bengal Code) was applicable in the first instance to Bengal",
  "Presidency  alone,  but  was  extended  in  slightly  modified",
  "forms  to  Madras  and  Bombay  Presidencies  in  1830.",
  "Preventing  Female  Infanticide  The  practice  of",
  "murdering female infants immediately after their birth was",
  "a common practice among upper class Bengalis and Rajputs",
  "who  considered  females  to  be  an  economic  burden.  The",
  "Bengal  regulations  of  1795  and  1804  declared  infanticide",
  "illegal and equivalent to murder. An Act passed in 1870 made",
  "it compulsory for parents to register the birth of all babies",
  "and provided for verification of female children for some",
  "years after birth, particularly in areas where the custom was",
  "resorted  to  in  utmost  secrecy.",
  "Widow Remarriage The Brahmo Samaj had the issue",
  "of widow remarriage high on its agenda and did much to",
  "popularise it. But it was mainly due to the efforts of Pandit",
  "Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (1820-91), the principal of Sans-",
  "krit College, Calcutta, that the Hindu Widows\u2019 Remarriage",
  "Act, 1856, was passed; it legalised marriage of widows and",
  "declared issues from such marriages as legitimate. Vidyasagar",
  "cited Vedic texts to prove that the Hindu religion sanctioned",
  "widow remarriage.",
  "Jagannath Shankar Seth and Bhau Daji were among the",
  "active  promoters  of  girls\u2019  schools  in  Maharashtra.  Vishnu",
  "Shastri Pandit founded the Widow Remarriage Association",
  "in the 1850s. Another prominent worker in this field wasSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 197",
  "Karsondas Mulji who started the Satya Prakash in Gujarati",
  "in 1852 to advocate widow remarriage. Similar efforts were",
  "made  by  Professor  D.K.  Karve  in  western  India  and  by",
  "Veerasalingam Pantulu in Madras. Karve himself married a",
  "widow in 1893. He dedicated his life to the upliftment of",
  "Hindu  widows  and  became  the  secretary  of  the  Widow",
  "Remarriage  Association.  He  opened  a  widows\u2019  home  in",
  "Poona to give the high caste widows an interest in life by",
  "providing them with facilities for vocational training. The",
  "right of widows to remarriage was also advocated by B.M.",
  "Malabari, Narmad (Narmadashankar Labhshankar Dave), Justice",
  "Govind Mahadeo Ranade and K. Natarajan among others.",
  "Controlling  Child  Marriage  The  Native  Marriage",
  "Act (or Civil Marriage Act), 1872 signified legislative action",
  "in prohibiting child marriage. It had a limited impact as the",
  "Act  was  not  applicable  to  Hindus,  Muslims  and  other",
  "recognised faiths. The relentless efforts of a Parsi reformer,",
  "B.M. Malabari, were rewarded by the enactment of the Age",
  "of Consent Act (1891) which forbade the marriage of girls",
  "below the age of 12. The Sarda Act (1930) further pushed",
  "up  the  marriage  age  to  18  and  14  for  boys  and  girls,",
  "respectively.  In  free  India,  the  Child  Marriage  Restraint",
  "(Amendment) Act, 1978 raised the age of marriage for girls",
  "from 15 to 18 years and for boys from 18 to 21.",
  "Education of Women The Christian missionaries were",
  "the first to set up the Calcutta Female Juvenile Society in",
  "1819.  The  Bethune  School,  founded  by  J.E.D.  Bethune,",
  "president of the Council of Education in Calcutta in 1849",
  "was the first fruit of the powerful movement for women\u2019s",
  "education that arose in the 1840s and 1850s. Pandit Ishwar",
  "Chandra Vidyasagar was associated with no less than 35 girls\u2019",
  "schools in Bengal and is considered one of the pioneers of",
  "women\u2019s education.",
  "Charles  Wood\u2019s  Despatch  on  Education  (1854)  laid",
  "great stress on the need for female education. In 1914, the",
  "Women\u2019s Medical Service did a lot of work in training nurses",
  "and mid-wives. The Indian Women\u2019s University set up by",
  "Professor D.K. Karve in 1916 was one of the outstanding",
  "institutions imparting education to women. In the same year",
  "Lady Hardinge Medical College was opened in Delhi.198 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Health facilities began to be provided to women with",
  "the  opening  of  Dufferin  Hospitals  in  the  1880s.",
  "Participation  in the swadeshi and anti-partition and the",
  "Home Rule movements during the opening decades of the",
  "twentieth century was a major liberating experience for the",
  "otherwise  home-centred  Indian  women.  After  1918,  they",
  "faced  lathis  and  bullets  and  were  jailed  during  political",
  "processions, picketing, etc. They actively participated in trade",
  "union  and  kisan  movements,  or  revolutionary  movements.",
  "They voted in, stood for and got elected to various legislatures",
  "and  local  bodies.  Sarojini  Naidu  went  on  to  become  the",
  "president of the Indian National Congress (1925) and later",
  "the  governor  of  the  United  Provinces  (1947-49).",
  "After  1920,  aware  and  self-confident  women  led  a",
  "women\u2019s movement. Many organisations and institutions such",
  "as the All India Women\u2019s Conference (established in 1927)",
  "came up.",
  "Women\u2019s  Organisations  In  1910,  Sarla  Devi",
  "Chaudhurani convened the first meeting of the Bharat Stree",
  "Mahamandal  in  Allahabad.  Considered  as  the  first  major",
  "Indian women\u2019s organisation set up by a woman, its objectives",
  "included promotion of education for women, abolition of the",
  "purdah system and improvement in the socio-economic and",
  "political status of woman all over India. Sarla Devi believed",
  "that the man working for women\u2019s upliftment lived \u2018under",
  "the shade of Manu\u2019.",
  "Ramabai Ranade founded the Ladies Social Conference",
  "(Bharat  Mahila  Parishad),  under  the  parent  organisation",
  "National Social Conference, in 1904 in Bombay.",
  "Pandita Ramabai Saraswati founded the Arya Mahila",
  "Samaj  to  serve  the  cause  of  women.  She  pleaded  for",
  "improvement in the educational syllabus of Indian women",
  "before the English Education Commission which was referred",
  "to Queen Victoria. This resulted in medical education for",
  "women which started in Lady Dufferin College. Later Ramabai",
  "Ranade  established  a  branch  of  Arya  Mahila  Samaj  in",
  "Bombay.",
  "In 1925, the National Council of Women in India, a",
  "national branch of the International Council of Women, wasSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 199",
  "formed. Mehribai Tata played a vital role in its formation",
  "and advancement. She opined that the purdah system, caste",
  "differences  and  lack  of  education  prevented  women  from",
  "working to solve societal problems. Other women who held",
  "important  positions  on  the  executive  committee  of  the",
  "council included Cornelia Sarabji, India\u2019s first lady barrister;",
  "Tarabai Premchand, wife of a wealthy banker; Shaffi Tyabji,",
  "a member of one of Mumbai\u2019s leading Muslim families; and",
  "Maharani Sucharu Devi, daughter of Keshab Chandra Sen.",
  "However, according to critics, the philanthropic style that was",
  "being  followed  by  these  women  was  that  of  upper-class",
  "English women.",
  "The All India Women\u2019s Conference (AIWC), founded",
  "by Margaret Cousins in 1927, was perhaps the first women\u2019s",
  "organisation with an egalitarian approach. Its first conference",
  "was  held  at  Ferguson  College,  Pune.  Important  founding",
  "members included Maharani Chimnabai Gaekwad, Rani Sahiba",
  "of Sangli, Sarojini Naidu, Kamla Devi Chattopadhyaya and",
  "Lady Dorab Tata. Its objectives were to work for a society",
  "based on principles of social justice, integrity, equal rights",
  "and opportunities; and to secure for every human being, the",
  "essentials of life, not determined by accident of birth or sex",
  "but by planned social distribution. For this purpose, the AIWC",
  "worked towards various legislative reforms before and after",
  "India\u2019s independence, some examples being Sarda Act (1929),",
  "Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Property Act (1937), Factory Act",
  "(1947),  Hindu  Marriage  and  Divorce  Act  (1954),  Special",
  "Marriage Act (1954), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act",
  "(1956), Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (1956), the",
  "Suppression  of  Immoral  Traffic  in  Women  Act  (1958),",
  "Maternity  Benefits  Act  (1961),  Dowry  Prohibition  Act",

  " Struggle Against Caste-Based Exploitation",
  "The later-Vedic conception of four-fold division of Hindu",
  "society got further subdivided into numerous sub-castes due",
  "to racial admixture, geographical expansion and diversification",
  "of crafts which gave rise to new vocations.",
  "The concept of Hindu chaturvarnashrama dictated that",
  "the caste of a person determined the status and relative purity200 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "of different sections of population. It was caste that determined",
  "who could get education or ownership of landed property,",
  "the kind of profession one should pursue, whom one could",
  "dine with or marry, etc. In general, caste decided a person\u2019s",
  "social loyalties even before birth. The dress, food, place of",
  "residence, sources of water for drinking and irrigation, entry",
  "into temples\u2014all these were regulated by the caste factor.",
  "The worst-hit by the discriminatory institution of caste",
  "were the \u2018untouchables\u2019 or the scheduled castes/dalits, as they",
  "came to be called later. The disabilities imposed on them",
  "were  humiliating,  inhuman  and  based  on  the  principle  of",
  "inequality by birth.",
  "Factors  that  Helped  to  Mitigate  Caste-based",
  "Discrimination",
  "\u25cf  British  rule,  perhaps  without  intention,  created",
  "certain  conditions  that  undermined  caste  consciousness",
  "to an extent. British rule in India unleashed certain forces,",
  "sometimes  through  direct  administrative  measures  and",
  "sometimes indirectly by creating suitable conditions. Though",
  "these measures had negative effects in one way, they had a",
  "positive  effect  too.  For  instance,  the  creation  of  private",
  "property in land and free sale of land upset caste equations.",
  "A  close  interlink  between  caste  and  vocation  could  not",
  "survive  as  village  autarchy  crumbled.  Besides,  modern",
  "commerce  and  industry  gave  rise  to  several  economic",
  "avenues while growing urbanisation and modern means of",
  "transport added to the mobility of populations. The British",
  "administration introduced the concept of equality before law",
  "in a uniformly applied system of law which dealt a severe",
  "blow  to  social  and  legal  inequalities,  while  the  judicial",
  "functions  of  caste  panchayats  were  taken  away.  The",
  "administrative services were made open to all castes and the",
  "new education system was on totally secular lines.",
  "\u25cf  The  social  reform  movements  also  strove  to",
  "undermine  caste-based  exploitation.  From  the  mid-19th",
  "century onwards, numerous organisations and groups such as",
  "the Brahmo Samaj, Prarthana Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna",
  "Mission,  the  Theosophists,  the  Social  Conference  and",
  "individuals worked to spread education among the untouchablesSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 201",
  "and  remove  restrictions  imposed  on  them  from  entering",
  "temples or using ponds, tanks, etc. Although many of them",
  "defended  the  chaturvarna  system,  they  criticised",
  "untouchability.  The  social  reformers  attacked  the  rigid",
  "hereditary basis of caste distinctions and the law of karma",
  "which  formed  the  basis  of  the  religio-philosophic  defence",
  "of  the  undemocratic  authoritarian  caste  institution.  They",
  "called on people to work for betterment in the real world",
  "in which they lived, rather than strive for salvation after death.",
  "For instance, the Arya Samaj while crusading against the",
  "disintegration of Hindu society into myriad sub-castes, aimed",
  "at  reconstructing  it  on  the  original  four-fold  division  and",
  "upholding the right of even the lowest castes to study the",
  "scriptures.",
  "\u25cf The national movement took inspiration from the",
  "principles  of  liberty  and  equality  against  the  forces",
  "which tended to divide the society. The national leaders",
  "and organisations opposed caste privileges, fought for equal",
  "civic rights and free development of the individual. The caste",
  "divisions were diluted, although in a limited manner, because",
  "of  mass  participation  in  demonstrations,  meetings  and",
  "satyagraha struggles. The Congress governments in various",
  "provinces after 1937 did some useful work for the upliftment",
  "of  the  depressed  classes;  for  instance,  free  education  for",
  "Harijans (\u2018untouchables\u2019) was introduced in some provinces.",
  "The rulers of states like Travancore, Indore and Devas took",
  "the initiative in opening all state temples by proclamation.",
  "Gandhi always had in mind the objective of eradicating",
  "untouchability by root and branch. His ideas were based on",
  "the grounds of humanism and reason. He argued that the",
  "Shastras did not sanction untouchability and, even if they",
  "did, they should be ignored since truth cannot be confined",
  "within the covers of a book. In 1932, he founded the All",
  "India Harijan Sangh.",
  "\u25cf  With  increasing  opportunities  of  education  and",
  "general  awakening,  there  were  stirrings  among  the",
  "lower castes themselves. This awakening gradually developed",
  "into  a  powerful  movement  in  defence  of  their  rights  and",
  "against upper caste oppression. In Maharashtra, Jyotiba Phule,202 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "born in a low caste Mali family, led a movement against the",
  "brahminical domination of Hindu society. He accorded the",
  "highest priority to education of lower castes, especially girls",
  "for whom he opened several schools.",
  "Babasaheb Ambedkar, who had experienced the worst",
  "form of casteist discrimination during his childhood, fought",
  "against upper caste tyranny throughout his life. He organised",
  "the All India Scheduled Castes Federation, while several other",
  "leaders  of  the  depressed  classes    founded  the  All  India",
  "Depressed  Classes  Association.  Ambedkar  condemned  the",
  "hierarchical and insular caste system as a whole, and advocated",
  "the  annihilation  of  the  institution  of  caste  for  the  real",
  "progress of the nation. The struggle of the depressed classes",
  "led  to  the  provision  of  special  representation  for  these",
  "classes in the Government of India Act, 1935.",
  "Others in the 1900s, such as the Maharaja of Kolhapur,",
  "encouraged the non-brahmin movement which spread to the",
  "southern states in the first decade of the twentieth century",
  "and  was  joined  by  the  Kammas,  Reddis,  Vellalas  (the",
  "powerful  intermediate  castes)  and  the  Muslims.",
  "During  the  1920s  in  South  India,  the  non-brahmins",
  "organised the Self-Respect Movement led by E.V. Ramaswamy",
  "Naicker. There were numerous other movements demanding",
  "that the ban on the entry of lower castes into temples be",
  "lifted. Sri Narayana Guru in Kerala led a lifelong struggle",
  "against upper caste domination. He coined the slogan \u201cone",
  "religion, one caste, one God for mankind\u201d, which his disciple",
  "Sahadaran Ayyapan changed into \u201cno religion, no caste, no",
  "God for mankind\u201d.",
  "Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar led the Mahad Satyagraha in",
  "March 1927 to challenge the regressive customs of the caste",
  "Hindus. He stressed the necessity of removing ideas of \u2018high\u2019",
  "and  \u2018low\u2019  and  inculcating  self-elevation  through  self-help,",
  "self-respect  and  self-knowledge.  He  led  a  procession  of",
  "some 2,500 \u2018untouchables\u2019 through the town of Mahad to the",
  "Chawdar tank, a public source of water tank from which the",
  "untouchables were not allowed to draw water. Dr Ambedkar",
  "took  water  from  the  tank  and  drank  it.  There  were  huge",
  "protests by caste Hindus. Later in December 1927, AmbedkarSocio-Religious Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 203",
  "and his colleagues burnt the \u2018Manusmriti\u2019 at the same place",
  "as a gesture of getting rid of inequalities.",
  "Dr  Ambedkar  established  the  Bahishkrit  Hitakarini",
  "Sabha in 1924 to highlight the difficulties and grievances of",
  "the dalits before the government. Its motto was: \u2018Educate,",
  "Agitate and Organise\u2019.",
  "\u25cf The Constitution of free India has made equality",
  "and non-discrimination on basis of caste imperative. The",
  "struggle against caste discrimination could not be successful",
  "during  the  British  rule.  The  foreign  government  had  its",
  "limitations\u2014it  could  not  afford  to  invite  hostile  reaction",
  "from the orthodox sections by taking up any radical measures.",
  "Also,  no social uplift was possible without economic and",
  "political upliftment. All this could be realised only under the",
  "government of a free India. The Constitution of free India",
  "abolishes untouchability and declares the endorsement of any",
  "disability arising out of untouchability as unlawful. It also",
  "forbids  any  restriction  on  access  to  wells,  tanks,  bathing",
  "ghats, hotels, cinemas, clubs, etc. In one of the Directive",
  "Principles, the Constitution has laid down that \u201cthe State shall",

  "increased if every cultivator could read.",
  "\u2014Bombay Governor",
  "[in a private letter to the Viceroy (1911)]",
  "The rising middle classes were politically inclined and were not",
  "so much in search of a religion; but they wanted some cultural",

  "and humiliation that foreign conquest and rule had produced.",
  "\u2014Jawaharlal Nehru",

  "the part of a Voltaire who had the intellectual honesty to rise",

  "danger to the maintenance of a civilisation which is contrived to",
  "maintain brahminic supremacy.",
  "\u2014B.R. Ambedkar",
  "Untouchability question is one of life and death for Hinduism. If",
