  "British Conquest",
  "The first half of the eighteenth century saw the decline of",
  "the  mighty  Mughals,  who  had  been  the  envy  of  their",
  "contemporaries  for  almost  two  centuries.  The  reign  of",
  "Aurangzeb (1658-1707) proved to signify the beginning of",
  "the end of Mughal rule in India. It is argued that Aurangzeb\u2019s",
  "misguided policies weakened the stability of the state and",
  "the decline gained momentum after his death due to wars",
  "of succession and weak rulers. Though Muhammad Shah ruled",
  "for  a  long  spell  of  29  years  (1719-48),  a  revival  of  the",
  "imperial fortunes did not take place as he was an incompetent",
  "ruler. Muhammad Shah\u2019s reign witnessed the establishment",
  "of the independent states of Hyderabad, Bengal, Awadh and",
  "Punjab. Several local chiefs began to assert their independence",
  "and  the  Marathas  began  to  make  their  bid  to  inherit  the",
  "imperial  mantle.",
  "  Challenges  before  the  Mughals",
  " External Challenges",
  "In the absence of internal strength, the Mughals could not",
  "put a tough front against external challenges which came in",
  "the form of several invasions from the north-west. The north-",
  "western borders had been neglected by the later Mughals and",
  "not much effort was expended in protecting the border.",

  "Nader Shah was Mughal emperor for only fifty-seven days, in",
  "1739, but those days created aftershocks that transformed India's",
  "politics.  They  broke  existing  centres  of  authority,  massively",
  "shrinking the scope of Mughal power. They set loose bands of",
  "mounted warriors who ransacked the countryside seeking wealth",
  "from villages and towns. They pushed traders behind the walls",
  "of whichever power had the strongest forts. For a short period",
  "plunder, rather than negotiation, became the most effective tool",
  "for creating new centres of wealth. Those fifty-seven days laid",
  "the ground which allowed the East India Company to conquer",
  "territory in India for the first time.",

  "Nadir  Shah,  the  Persian  emperor,  attacked  India  in",
  "1738-39, conquered Lahore and defeated the Mughal army",
  "at Karnal on February 13, 1739. Later, Muhammad Shah was",
  "captured, and Delhi looted and devastated. According to an",
  "estimate, apart from the Peacock Throne and the Kohinoor",
  "diamond,  seventy  crore  rupees  were  collected  from  the",
  "official treasury and the safes of the rich nobles. Nadir Shah",
  "gained  the  strategically  important  Mughal  territory  to  the",
  "west of the Indus including Kabul. Thus, India once again",
  "became vulnerable to the attacks from the north-west.",
  "Ahmad Shah Abdali (or Ahmad Shah Durrani), who",
  "was elected the successor of Nadir Shah after the latter\u2019s",
  "death in 1747, invaded India several times between 1748 and",
  "1767. He continuously harassed the Mughals who tried to",
  "buy peace in 1751-52 by ceding Punjab to him. In 1757,",
  "Abdali captured Delhi and left behind an Afghan caretaker",
  "to watch over the Mughal emperor. Before his return, Abdali",
  "had recognised Alamgir II as the Mughal emperor and the",
  "Rohilla chief, Najib-ud-Daula, as Mir Bakhshi of the empire,",
  "who was to act as personal \u2018supreme agent\u2019 of Abdali. In",
  "1758,  Najib-ud-Daula  was  expelled  from  Delhi  by  the",
  "Maratha chief, Raghunath Rao, who also captured Punjab. In",
  "1759, Ahmad Shah Abdali returned to India to take revenge",
  "on the Marathas. In 1761, Abdali defeated the Marathas in",
  "the Third Battle of Panipat. The last of Abdali\u2019s invasions",

  "Why Many Empire-shaking Battles at Panipat?",
  "Panipat and its adjacent region, located in present Haryana on the",
  "banks of the Yamuna and between the fertile plains of the Ganga",
  "and Indus rivers, have witnessed several battles. These battles",
  "changed the course of Indian history at different points of time.",
  "\u25cf The first Battle of Panipat in 1526 was between Babur and",
  "Ibrahim Lodi. The result of the battle laid the foundation of the",
  "Mughal Empire by ending the rule of the Delhi Sultanate.",
  "\u25cf The Second Battle of Panipat in 1556 was between Akbar",
  "and Hemu; it decided in favour of the continuation of the Mughal",
  "rule.",
  "\u25cf The Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 between the Marathas",
  "and Ahmad Shah Abdali put an end to the Maratha ambition of",
  "ruling over India.",
  "Why Panipat was a favourite battle field",
  "\u25cf Panipat had a strategic location. One of the parties of the",
  "war generally came from the north/northwest through the Khyber",
  "Pass to get hold over Delhi, the political capital of northern India.",
  "To move a military through rough terrains\u2014deserts of Rajasthan",
  "or the other northern areas infested with dense forests\u2014was very",
  "risky and difficult. On the other hand, the rulers at Delhi considered",
  "Panipat as a confrontable strategic ground and hence they preferred",
  "to take the fight there.",
  "\u25cf Its proximity to Delhi made it easier for the Indian rulers",
  "to  transport  weapons,  military  and  food  supplies  etc.,  to  the",
  "battleground, and still keep the capital insulated from the conflict",
  "at hand.",
  "\u25cf Panipat\u2019s surrounding region has a flat ground which was",
  "suitable for cavalry movement\u2014the main mode of warfare at the",
  "time.",
  "\u25cf After the construction of the Grand Trunk Road by Sher Shah",
  "Suri (1540-45), Panipat was on this route. It became easier for",
  "conquerors to find their way there.",
  "\u25cf The duration of monsoon rainfall in the region is short in",
  "comparison to other areas making it easier to fight.",
  "\u25cf The artisans/smiths of these regions were experts in making",
  "warfare-related materials and hence it became easier for forces of",
  "both parties to replenish their war materials.62 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",

  "Causes  of  Decline  of  Mughal",
  "Empire",
  "Why  the  Mughal  Empire  declined  has  been  a  subject  of",
  "debate among historians. Scholarly opinion can be divided",
  "along  two  broad  lines\u2014those  who  view  the  matter  as",
  "generally  empire-related  and  those  who  regard  the",
  "developments  as  region-related.  The  empire-related  or",
  "Mughal-centric view sees the causes of the decline within",
  "the structure and functioning of the empire itself. The region-",
  "related view finds the causes of Mughal decline in the turmoil",
  "and  instability  in  the  different  parts  of  the  empire.  The",
  "decline was due to both aspects.",
  "The process of disintegration of the Mughal Empire",
  "began  during  the  reign  of  Aurangzeb,  but  it  picked  up",
  "momentum  only  after  his  death  in  1707.  At  his  death,",
  "conditions were not such that the process of decline could",
  "not be checked. Although Mughal authority was challenged",
  "by several chiefs and rulers, none could assert independence",
  "in the face of the imperial might. The Sikhs, Marathas and",
  "Rajputs did not possess the capacity to overthrow the empire;",
  "they merely resisted Mughal power to gain and keep their",
  "independence  in  their  respective  territories.  Thus,  if  the",
  "successors of Aurangzeb had been capable rulers, the empire",
  "might not have fallen. Most of the emperors who came after",
  "Aurangzeb  proved  to  be  incapable,  weak  and  licentious",
  "monarchs who hastened the process of disintegration of the",
  "empire  and,finally,  its  collapse.India on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 65",
  "The major factors which contributed to the downfall",
  "of the Mughal Empire are discussed below.",
  " Shifting Allegiance of Zamindars",
  "Two classes shared the power of the State with the emperor",
  "during the medieval period\u2014the zamindars and the nobles.",
  "The zamindars were hereditary owners of their lands who",
  "enjoyed  certain  privileges  on  hereditary  basis,  and  were",
  "variously known as rais, rajas, thakurs,  khuts or deshmukhs.",
  "They occupied an important place in the empire because they",
  "helped in the collection of revenue and in local administration,",
  "for which they maintained soldiers. Though the Mughals had",
  "tried to curb the power of the zamindars and maintain direct",
  "contact with the peasants, they had not wholly succeeded.",
  "During the reign of Aurangzeb itself, there was a marked",
  "increase in the power and influence of the zamindars. The",
  "biggest  fallout  of  this  was  that  regional  loyalties  were",
  "encouraged. Many local zamindars helped the nobility, the",
  "other powerful class within the empire, to take advantage of",
  "the  weakness  of  the  empire  and  carve  out  independent",
  "kingdoms  for  themselves.",
  " Jagirdari Crisis",
  "The  nobility  comprised  people  who  were  either  assigned",
  "large jagirs and mansabs or appointed subahdars of Mughal",
  "subas and given the responsibility of maintaining these. To",
  "this  class  belonged  many  Rajput  rulers,  subahdars  and",
  "mansabdars. Mughal rule has often been defined as \u201cthe rule",
  "of the nobility\u201d, because these nobles played a central role",
  "in administering the empire. Although Akbar had provided a",
  "well-knit organisation for them, there was divisiveness among",
  "the nobility on the basis of religion, homeland and tribe, and",
  "each category formed a group of its own. Mutual rivalry,",
  "jealousy and contest for power among the various groups",
  "during the rule of the later Mughals (in the absence of a",
  "strong central leadership) not only reduced the prestige of",
  "the  emperor,  but  also  contributed  to  the  decline  of  the",
  "empire.66 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Views",
  "The roots of the disintegration of the Mughal empire may be",
  "found in the Medieval Indian economy; the stagnation of trade,",
  "industry  and  scientific  development  within  the  limits  of  that",
  "economy; the growing financial crisis which took the form of",
  "a crisis of the jagirdari system and affected every branch of",
  "state  activity;  the  inability  of  the  nobility  to  realise  in  the",
  "circumstances their ambitions in the service of the state and",
  "consequently the struggle of factions and the bid of ambitious",
  "nobles for independent dominion; the inability of the Mughal",
  "emperors to accommodate the Marathas and to adjust their",
  "claims within the framework of the Mughal empire, and the",
  "consequent breakdown of the attempt to create a composite",
  "ruling class in India; and the impact of all these developments",
  "on politics at the court and in the country, and upon the security",
  "of the north-western passes. Individual failings and faults of",
  "character also played their due  role  but they have necessarily",
  "to be seen against the background of these deeper, more",
  "impersonal factors.",

  "is with what our 17th and early 18th century authorities have",

  "\u2014William Irvine, Army of the Indian Mughals",
  "A common impression is, that...the decline, fall of the Mughal",
  "Empire were due to the degeneracy  of its sovereigns. But...it",
  "was irretrievably ruined in the reign of Aurangzeb, a monarch",
  "of great ability, energy and determination, but lacking in political",
  "insight, and a bigoted Mussulman. He struck the first mortal",
  "blow by reversing Akbar\u2019s wise and generous policy of ignoring",
  "distinctions of race and religion, and reimposing the jizya or poll",
  "tax, on his Hindu subjects; whereby he estranged them, and",
  "turned the noblest and most warlike of them\u2014the Rajputs,",
  "hitherto the staunchest supporters of the throne\u2014into deadly and",
  "persistent  enemies.  And  Shivaji  and  his  followers  not  only",

  " Rise of Regional Aspirations",
  "Aurangzeb\u2019s reign itself witnessed powerful regional groups",
  "like the Jats, Sikhs and Marathas defying the authority of the",
  "Mughal state in their bid to create kingdoms of their own.",
  "They did not succeed in their efforts, but they influenced",
  "the  future  course  of  political  events  in  their  respective",
  "regions.  Their  continuous  struggle  against  the  empire  for",
  "political  ascendancy  weakened  the  empire  considerably.",
  "Aurangzeb, and after him Bahadur Shah I, by attempting to",
  "suppress  the  Rajputs,  spurred  them  to  battle  against  the",
  "Mughals. The later Mughals made an effort to follow a policy",
  "of reconciliation with the Rajputs, but by then it was already",
  "too late: the Rajputs no longer trusted the Mughals enough",
  "to ally with them for the welfare of the empire.",
  "Causes of the Mughals\u2019 Downfall in a Nutshell",
  "Some of the main causes for the decline of the Mughals, briefly",
  "put, were as follows:",
  "(i) The government of the Mughals was a personal despotism",
  "and so its success depended on the character of the reigning",
  "ruler. The later Mughals were worthless and neglected the",
  "administration of the state.",
  "(ii) With the absence of a definite law of succession, there always",
  "occurred a war of succession; this weakened the stability of",
  "the government, and fostered partisanship at the cost of",
  "patriotism.",
  "(iii) The degeneration of the rulers led to the degeneration of the",
  "nobility, with factious quarrels and intrigues costing the empire",
  "heavily.",
  "(iv) The deterioration of the army also proved disastrous for the",
  "empire.",
  "(v) The empire had become too vast and unwieldy to be efficiently",
  "governed from a central authority under weak rulers, especially",
  "under the existing conditions of transport and communication.",
  "(vi) Aurangzeb\u2019s religious policy was largely responsible, leading",
  "to revolts by Rajputs, Sikhs, Jats and Marathas.",
  "(vii) Aurangzeb\u2019s Deccan policy was a complete failure and was",
  "an important cause of the downfall of the Mughal empire.",
  "(viii) Invasions of Irani and Durrani kingdoms gave a death-blow",
  "to the Mughal empire.India on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 69",
  "The Marathas too were becoming a formidable enemy.",
  "Their aim was at first limited only to regaining control over",
  "the region of Maharashtra; but it soon went on to include",
  "getting legal sanction from the Mughal emperor for collecting",
  "sardeshmukhi  and  chauth  throughout  India.  They  forged",
  "northwards  and,  by  1740,  succeeded  in  spreading  their",
  "influence  over  the  provinces  of  Gujarat,  Malwa  and",
  "Bundelkhand. The Rajput struggle against the empire and the",
  "growing ambition and power of the Marathas, thus, adversely",
  "affected the Mughal might.",
  " Economic and Administrative Problems",
  "The number of amirs and their ranks or mansabs had increased",
  "sharply over time; there was little land left to be distributed",
  "among them as jagirs. Aurangzeb tried to solve the problem",
  "of acute shortage of jagirs or bejagiri by showing enhanced",
  "income  from  the  jagirs  on  record.  But  this  was  a  short-",
  "sighted measure as the amirs tried to recover the recorded",
  "income from their jagirs by pressurising the peasantry. So",
  "both the amirs and the peasantry were antagonised. Then there",
  "were the wars, the luxurious lifestyles of the emperors and",
  "amirs  alike,  the  reduction  in  khalisa  land,  all  of  which",
  "burdened the state. The result was that the expenditure of",
  "the  state  much  exceeded  its  income.",
  "There  was,  moreover,  no  significant  scientific  and",
  "technological advance that could have improved a stagnant",
  "economy.  The  once  flourishing  trade  did  not  enrich  the",
  "empire\u2019s  coffers  even  as  the  inroads  by  European  traders",
  "grew along coastal India.",
  "These  economic  and  administrative  problems  only",
  "multiplied following the death of Aurangzeb. The empire had",
  "become too vast to be efficiently administered by a centralised",
  "system when the rulers were weak and incompetent.",
  "  Rise  of  Regional  States",
  "The states that emerged as a result of the decline of the",
  "Mughal Empire can be classified into the following three",
  "broad  categories:",

  "that turned into states after breaking away from the empire.70 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",

  "(ii)  Independent  Kingdoms  These  states  came  into",
  "existence primarily due to the destabilisation of the Mughal",
  "control over the provinces, examples being Mysore and the",

  "Khan, popularly known as Nizam-ul-Mulk. It was Zulfikar",
  "Khan who had first conceived the idea of an independent state",
  "in the Deccan. But with his death in 1713 the dream remained",
  "unfulfilled. Kilich Khan, disgusted with the Mughal emperor",
  "who had appointed Mubariz Khan as a full-fledged viceroy",
  "of the Deccan, decided to fight Mubariz Khan. He defeated",
  "and later killed Mubariz Khan in the Battle of Shakr-Kheda",
  "(1724). He now assumed control of the Deccan. In 1725,",
  "he became the viceroy and conferred on himself the title of",
  "Asaf-Jah.",
  "Awadh",
  "The founder of the independent principality of Awadh was",
  "Saadat Khan, popularly known as Burhan-ul-Mulk. Saadat",
  "Khan was a Shia. He had joined in a conspiracy against the",
  "Sayyid brothers, which resulted in his being given an increased",
  "mansab. Later, driven out of the court, he was prompted to",
  "found  a  new  independent  state.  Saadat  Khan  committed",
  "suicide due to pressure from Nadir Shah who was demanding",
  "a huge booty from him. He was succeeded by Safdar Jang",
  "as the Nawab of Awadh.",
  "Bengal",
  "Murshid Kuli Khan was the founder of the independent state",
  "of  Bengal.  He  was  a  capable  ruler  and  made  Bengal  aIndia on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 71",
  "prosperous state. He was succeeded in 1727 by his son Shuja-",
  "ud-din. His successor, Sarfaraz Khan, was killed in 1740 by",
  "Alivardi Khan, the deputy governor of Bihar at Gheria, who",
  "assumed power and made himself independent of the Mughal",
  "emperor by giving yearly tribute.",
  "The Rajputs",
  "The Rajputs tried to re-establish their independence in the",
  "18th century. This forced the Mughal ruler Bahadur Shah I",
  "to  march  against  Ajit  Singh  (1708),  who  had  formed  an",
  "alliance  with  Jai  Singh  II  and  Durgadas  Rathor.  But  the",
  "alliance  was  broken  and  the  situation  was  saved  for  the",
  "Mughals.  At  one  time  the  Rajputs  controlled  the  entire",
  "territory extending from the south of Delhi up to the western",
  "coast.",
  "Mysore",
  "Another  important  state  to  make  its  appearance  in  the",
  "eighteenth century was that of Mysore. This territory located",
  "at the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghats was ruled",
  "by the Wodeyars. Various powers, interested in this territory,",
  "turned the area into a constant battlefield. In the end the",
  "Mysore state was brought under the rule of Haider Ali who",
  "ruled the state but not without trouble. He was involved in",
  "constant warfare with the British and so was his son Tipu",
  "Sultan.",
  "Kerala",
  "Martanda Varma established an independent state of Kerala",
  "with Travancore as his capital. He extended the boundaries",
  "of his state from Kanyakumari to Cochin. He made efforts",
  "to organise his army along the Western model and adopted",
  "various measures to develop his state.",
  "The Jats",
  "The agriculturist Jat settlers living around Delhi, Mathura, and",
  "Agra revolted against the oppressive policies of Aurangzeb.",
  "After  some  initial  setbacks,  Churaman  and  Badan  Singh",
  "succeeded in setting up the Jat state of Bharatpur. But it was",
  "under Suraj Mal that Jat power reached its zenith. He not",
  "only provided an efficient system of administration but also72 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "greatly extended the territory of the state. His state included",
  "territories from Ganga in the east to Chambal in the south",
  "and  included  the  Subahs  of  Agra,  Mathura,  Meerut  and",
  "Aligarh. However, the Jat state suffered a decline after the",
  "death of Suraj Mal in 1763. Thereafter, the state split into",
  "small areas controlled by petty zamindars who mainly lived",
  "by plunder.",
  "The Sikhs",
  "Guru Gobind Singh transformed the Sikhs into a militant sect",
  "in defence of their religion and liberties. Banda Bahadur, who",
  "later  assumed  the  leadership  of  the  Sikhs  in  1708,  was",
  "defeated and killed. In the wake of the invasions of Nadir",
  "Shah and Ahmad Shah Abdali, the Sikhs once again asserted",
  "their authority. At this stage they organised themselves into",
  "12  misls  or  confederacies  which  exercised  control  over",
  "different parts of the kingdom. The credit for establishing",
  "a strong kingdom of Punjab goes to Ranjit Singh. He was",
  "the son of Mahan Singh, the leader of the Sukarchakiya misl.",
  "Ranjit Singh brought under control the area extending from",
  "the Sutlej to the Jhelum. He conquered Lahore in 1799 and",
  "Amritsar in 1802. By the Treaty of Amritsar with the British,",
  "Ranjit Singh acknowledged the British right over the cis-",
  "Sutlej  territories.  Ranjit  Singh  proved  to  be  an  efficient",
  "administrator. He greatly modernised his army with the help",
  "of Europeans. But towards the close of his reign, the English",
  "forced him to sign the Tripartite Treaty in 1838 with Shah",
  "Shuja and the English Company whereby he agreed to provide",
  "passage to the British troops through Punjab with a view to",
  "placing Shah Shuja on the throne of Kabul. Ranjit Singh died",
  "in 1839. His successors could not keep the state intact and,",
  "soon  enough,  the  British  took  control  over  it.",
  "The Marathas",
  "Perhaps the most formidable province to emerge was that",
  "of the Marathas. Under the capable leadership of the Peshwas,",
  "the Marathas uprooted the Mughal authority from Malwa and",
  "Gujarat and established their rule. At one time they claimed",
  "the right to be the chief inheritors of the Mughal dominion,",
  "but their authority was challenged by Ahmed Shah Abdali inIndia on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 73",
  "the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The Marathas quickly",
  "recovered from the defeat and offered the most formidable",
  "challenge to the English East India Company in the struggle",
  "for political supremacy in India.",
  "Rohilakhand and Farukhabad",
  "The states of Rohilakhand and the kingdom of the Bangash",
  "Pathans were a fall out of the Afghan migration into India.",
  "Large scale immigration of Afghans into India took place in",
  "mid-18th century because of political and economic turmoil",
  "in Afghanistan. Ali Muhammad Khan took advantage of the",
  "collapse of authority in north India following Nadir Shah\u2019s",
  "invasion, to set up a petty kingdom, Rohilakhand. This was",
  "the area of the Himalayan foothills between Kumaon in the",
  "north  and  the  Ganga  in  the  south.  The  Rohillas,  as  the",
  "inhabitants of Rohilakhand were known, suffered heavily at",
  "the hands of the other powers in the area, the Jats and the",
  "Awadh  rulers  and,  later,  the  Marathas  and  the  British.",
  "Mohammad Khan Bangash, an Afghan, set up an independent",
  "kingdom to the east of Delhi in the area around Farrukhabad,",
  "during the reigns of Farrukhsiyar and Muhammad Shah.",
  " Nature and Limitations of Regional States",
  "The  independent  political  systems  that  emerged  in  the",
  "provinces continued to maintain ties with the Mughal imperial",
  "authority and acknowledged the emperor\u2019s importance as an",
  "umbrella. Even rebel chieftains of the Marathas and Sikhs",
  "recognised the Mughal emperor as the supreme authority.",
  "The polity that emerged in these states was regional",
  "in character, and functional with the collaborative support of",
  "the different local groups like the zamindars, merchants, local",
  "nobles and chieftains. The provincial rulers had to take care",
  "of these various local interests in order to maintain themselves.",
  "Of course, there were exceptions; for instance, in Mysore,",
  "rulers  did  not  recognise  the  local  chieftains.",
  "The regional states had certain limitations. The provincial",
  "rulers failed to develop a system based on sound financial,",
  "administrative  and  military  organisation.  Though  some  of",
  "them tried to modernise, notably Mysore, on the whole, they",
  "were backward in science and technology. Another drawback74 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "was the constant warfare these states had with the neighbouring",
  "regional  powers\u2014wars  in  which  none  could  ultimately",
  "dominate.  In  fact,  these  states  were  strong  enough  to",
  "challenge Mughal power, but none was able to replace it with",
  "a stable polity at an all-India level.",
  "The  jagirdari  crisis  intensified  as  income  from",
  "agriculture  declined,  and  the  number  of  contenders  for  a",
  "share of the surplus multiplied. Though trade, internal and",
  "foreign, continued without disruption and even prospered, the",
  "rest  of  the  economy  stagnated.",
  "  Socio-Economic  Conditions",
  "Eighteenth century India failed to make progress economically,",
  "socially or culturally, at an adequate pace. India became a",
  "land of contrasts because extreme poverty and extreme luxury",
  "existed  side  by  side.  The  common  populace  remained",
  "impoverished, backward and oppressed and lived at the bare",
  "subsistence level; the rich and the powerful enjoyed a life",
  "of luxury and lavishness. But it is worth noting that the life",
  "of the Indian masses was, by and large, better in the 18th",
  "century than it was after 100 years of British rule.",
  " Agriculture",
  "Though agriculture was technically backward, it was worked",
  "by the hard labour of peasants. But this hard working class",
  "seldom  got  the  fruits  of  their  labour.  Even  though  the",
  "agricultural  produce  supported  the  rest  of  the  society,  a",
  "peasant\u2019s own reward was miserably inadequate. They were",
  "forced to pay exorbitant amounts to the state, the zamindars,",
  "the  jagirdars,  and  the  revenue-farmers.  But  this  worsened",
  "under  British  rule.",
  " Trade and Industry",
  "On  account  of  being  self-sufficient  in  handicrafts  and",
  "agricultural products, India did not import foreign goods on",
  "a large scale. On the other hand, its industrial and agricultural",
  "products were in good demand in foreign markets. Hence its",
  "exports were more than its imports; trade was balanced by",
  "import of silver and gold. India was known as a sink of",
  "precious  metals.India on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 75",

  "India was a far greater industrial and manufacturing nation than",
  "any in Europe or any other in Asia. Her textile goods\u2014the fine",
  "products of her looms, in cotton, wool, linen and silk\u2014were",
  "famous over the civilised world; so were her exquisite jewellery",

  "coast against the Portuguese. According to Bipan Chandra,",
  "the European companies bought many Indian-made ships for",
  "their  use.",
  " Status of Education",
  "The  education  imparted  in  18th-century  India  was  still",
  "traditional which could not match with the rapid developments",
  "in the West. The knowledge was confined to literature, law,",
  "religion, philosophy, and logic and excluded the study of",
  "physical and natural sciences, technology and geography. In",
  "fact,  due  to  over-reliance  placed  on  ancient  learning,  any",
  "original thought got discouraged. Elementary education among",
  "the Hindus and the Muslims was quite widespread. The Hindu",
  "and Muslim elementary schools were called pathshalas and",
  "maktabs respectively. The education was confined to reading,",
  "writing,  and  arithmetic.  Children  from  the  lower  caste",
  "sometimes  attended  the  schools,  but  female  presence  was",
  "rare.",
  "Chatuspathis or Tols, as they were called in Bihar and",
  "Bengal, were the centres of higher education. Some of the",
  "famous centres for Sanskrit education were Kasi (Varanasi),",
  "Tirhut  (Mithila),  Nadia  and  Utkala.  Madrasahs  were  the",
  "institutions of higher learning for Persian and Arabic, Persian",
  "being the court language and learnt by the Muslims as well",
  "as the Hindus. Azimabad (Patna) was a famous centre for",
  "Persian education. People interested in the study of the Quran",
  "and Muslim theology had to acquire proficiency in Arabic.",
  " Societal Set-up",
  "Many Castes, Many Sects",
  "The  society  of  18th  century  India  was  characterised  by",
  "traditional outlook and stagnation. Though there existed aIndia on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 77",
  "certain degree of broad cultural unity, people were divided",
  "by  caste,  religion,  region,  tribe  and  language.  The  family",
  "system was primarily patriarchal and caste was the central",
  "feature of the social life of the Hindus. Apart from the four",
  "varnas, Hindus were divided into numerous sub-castes which",
  "permanently fixed their place in the social scale. Though the",
  "choice  of  profession  was  mainly  determined  by  caste",
  "considerations, exceptions occurred on a large scale, making",
  "caste status quite fluid in some parts of the country. Caste",
  "councils and panchayats enforced caste norms and regulations.",
  "Even though Islam enjoined social equality on the Muslims,",
  "they too were divided by considerations of caste, race, tribe",
  "and status. Religious considerations not only kept the Sunni",
  "and Shia nobles apart but also the Irani, Afghan, Turani and",
  "Hindustani  Muslim  nobles  and  officials  apart  from  one",
  "another. The sharif Muslims consisting of nobles, scholars,",
  "priests and army affairs often looked down upon the ajlaf",
  "Muslims or the lower class Muslims in a manner similar to",
  "the way of the higher-caste Hindus treated the lower-caste",
  "Hindus. Religious conversions occurred and caste proved to",
  "be a major divisive force and element of disintegration in",
  "18th century India.",
  "Position  of  Women  in  Society",
  "In the patriarchal family system in India (except in some",
  "social groups in Kerala), women possessed little individuality",
  "of their own, though there were a few exceptions. While",
  "upper class women remained at home, lower class women",
  "worked in fields and outside their homes supplementing the",
  "family  income.  Certain  outdated  and  exploitative  social",
  "customs  and  traditions  such  as  the  purdah,  sati,  child",
  "marriage, polygamy did exist which hindered the progress of",
  "women. The plight of the Hindu widow was usually miserable.",
  "View",
  "A Hindu woman can go anywhere alone, even in the most",
  "crowded places, and she need never fear the impertinent looks",
  "and jokes of idle loungers.",

  "of the nineteenth century78 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "The evil of dowry was especially widespread in Bengal and",
  "Rajputana. Sensitive Indians were often touched by the hard",
  "and harsh life of the widows. Raja Sawai Jai Singh of Amber",
  "and the Maratha General Prashuram Bhau tried to promote",
  "widow remarriage but failed.",
  "Menace  of  Slavery",
  "European travellers and administrators, who came in the 17th",
  "century,  reported  the  widespread  prevalence  of  slaves  in",
  "India. It is believed that some people were compelled to sell",
  "their  offspring  due  to  economic  distress,  famines,  natural",
  "calamities and extreme poverty. Generally higher classes of",
  "Rajputs, Khatris and Kayasthas kept women slave for domestic",
  "work. However, the status of slaves in India was better than",
  "that  in  Europe.  Slaves,  were  usually  treated  as  hereditary",
  "servants rather than as menials. Marriages took place among",
  "the slaves, and the offspring coming out of such wedlock",
  "were  considered  free  citizens.",
  "The advent of Europeans heightened the slavery and",
  "slave trade in India. European trading companies purchased",
  "slaves from the markets of Bengal, Assam and Bihar and took",
  "them to the European and American market. Abyssinian slaves",
  "were sold at Surat, Madras and Calcutta.",
  " Developments in Art, Architecture",
  "and Culture",
  "The decline of the imperial Mughals forced talented people",
  "to seek the patronage of newly established state courts like",
  "Hyderabad, Lucknow, Jaipur, Murshidabad, Patna, Kashmir,",
  "etc.",
  "At Lucknow, Asaf-ud-Daula built the bada Imambara",
  "in 1784. In the first half of the 18th century, Sawai Jai Singh",
  "built the pink city of Jaipur and five astronomical observatives",
  "at  Delhi,  Jaipur,  Benares,  Mathura  and  Ujjain.  He  also",
  "prepared  a  set  of  time-tables  called  Jij  Muhammad-shahi,",
  "to help the people in the study of astronomy. In the south,",
  "in  Kerala,  the  Padmanabhapuram  Palace,  famous  for  its",
  "architecture and mural paintings, was constructed.",
  "New  schools  of  painting  were  born  and  achieved",
  "distinction.  The  paintings  of  the  Rajputana  and  Kangra",
  "schools became prominent and revealed new vitality and taste.India on the Eve of British Conquest  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 79",
  "A distinct feature of the literary life of the 18th century",
  "was the growth of Urdu language and poetry. It was the period",
  "of Urdu poets like Mir, Sauda, Nazir and Mirza Ghalib (19th",
  "century).  In  south  India,  Malayalam  literature  flourished",
  "under  the  patronage  of  the  Travancore  rulers.  Kanchan",
  "Nambiar was a noted Malayalam poet. The Tamil language",
  "was enriched by sittar poetry. Tayumanavar (1706-44), one",
  "of the best exponents of sittar poetry, protested against the",
  "abuses of temple-rule and the caste system. Heer Ranjha,",
  "the  romantic  epic  in  Punjabi  literature,  was  composed  by",
  "Warris Shah. In Sindhi literature, Shah Abdul Latif composed",
  "Risalo, a collection of poems. These are just some examples",
