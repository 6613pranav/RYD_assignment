  "History of Modern India",
  "Looking at how histories are written is part of the study of",
  "the intellectual history of the period under discussion and",
  "can provide a variety of ideas and explanations. The starting",
  "point  in  the  history  of  a  society,  therefore,  has  to  be  a",
  "familiarity with its historiography\u2014the study of historical",
  "interpretation. This provides recognition of the intellectual",
  "context of history, instead of seeing history as just a narration",
  "of events. The modern history of India, for the convenience",
  "of understanding, can be read broadly under four approaches\u2014",
  "the Colonial (or the Imperialist), Nationalist, Marxist, and",
  "Subaltern\u2014each  with  its  own  distinct  characteristics  and",
  "modes of interpretation. However, there are other approaches\u2014",
  "Communalist,  Cambridge,  Liberal  and  Neo-liberal,  and",
  "Feminist interpretations\u2014which have also influenced historical",
  "writing on modern India.",
  "View",
  "The production of histories of India has become very frequent",
  "in recent years and may well call for some explanations\u2026 The",
  "reason is a two-fold one: changes in the Indian scene requiring",
  "a reinterpretation of the facts and changes in the attitudes of",
  "historians about the essential elements of Indian history.",

  "Colonial  Approach/",
  "Historiography",
  "For the major part of the 19th century the Colonial School",
  "occupied a high position in India. The term \u2018colonial approach\u2019",
  "has been used in two senses. One relates to the history of",
  "the colonial countries, while the other refers to the works",
  "which were influenced by the colonial ideology of domination.",
  "It is in the second sense that most historians today write",
  "about  the  colonial  historiography.  In  fact,  the  practice  of",
  "writing about the colonial countries by the colonial officials",
  "was related to the desire for domination and justification of",
  "the colonial rule. Hence, in most such historical works there",
  "was  criticism  of  indigenous  society  and  culture.",
  "Simultaneously, there was praise for the Western culture and",
  "values and glorification of the individuals who established the",
  "colonial  empires.  The  histories  of  India  written  by  James",
  "Mill,  Mountstuart  Elphinstone,  Vincent  Smith  and  many",
  "others are pertinent examples of the colonial historiographical",
  "trend. Certain characteristics common to most of the works",
  "of  these  historians  are  the  following:",
  "(i) \u2018Orientalist\u2019  representation  of  India;",
  "(ii) the opinion that the British brought unity to India;",
  "(iii) the  notions  of  Social  Darwinism\u2014the  English",
  "considered themselves superior to the \u2018natives\u2019 and",
  "the  fittest  to  rule;",
  "(iv) India viewed as a stagnant society which required",
  "guidance from the British (White Man\u2019s burden); and",
  "(v) establishing Pax Britannica to bring law and order",
  "and peace to a bickering society.",
  "Nationalist  Historiography/",
  "Approach",
  "The nationalist approach to Indian history can be described",
  "as one which tends to contribute to the growth of nationalistMajor Approaches to the History of Modern India \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 15",
  "feelings and to unify people in the face of religious, caste,",
  "or linguistic differences or class differentiation. This approach",
  "looks at the national movement as a movement of the Indian",
  "people, which grew out of the growing awareness among all",
  "people  of  the  exploitative  nature  of  colonial  rule.  This",
  "approach developed as a response to and in confrontation with",
  "the colonial approach. It should be noted that the nationalist",
  "historians of modern India didn\u2019t exist before 1947. Before",
  "1947, nationalist historiography mainly dealt with the ancient",
  "and medieval periods of Indian history. However, in the last",
  "quarter of the 19th century, a detailed and scientific critique",
  "of colonialism for the adverse economic aspects of alien rule",
  "was developed by nationalists like Dadabhai Naoroji, M.G.",
  "Ranade, G.V. Joshi, R.C. Dutt, K.T. Telang, G.K. Gokhale,",
  "and D.E. Wacha. The only accounts of the national movement",
  "was  by  nationalist  leaders  (not  historians)  such  as  R.G.",
  "Pradhan, A.C. Mazumdar, J.L. Nehru and Pattabhi Sitaramayya.",
  "R.C. Majumdar and Tara Chand are noted nationalist historians",
  "of modern India.",
  "Marxist  Historiography/",
  "Approach",
  "The beginning of the Marxist approach in India was heralded",
  "by two classic books\u2014Rajni Palme Dutt\u2019s India Today and",
  "A.R.  Desai\u2019s  Social  Background  of  Indian  Nationalism.",
  "Originally written for the famous Left Book Club in England,",
  "India Today, first published in 1940 in England, was later",
  "published in India in 1947. A.R. Desai\u2019s Social Background",
  "of  Indian  Nationalism,  was  first  published  in  1948.",
  "Unlike  the  imperialist/colonial  approach,  the  Marxist",
  "historians clearly see the primary contradiction between the",
  "interests of the colonial masters and the subject people, as",
  "well as the process of the nation-in-the-making. Unlike the",
  "nationalists, they also take full note of the inner contradictions",
  "between the different sections of the people of the Indian",
  "society. However, some of them, particularly Rajni Palme16",
  "16 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Dutt, were unable to fully integrate their treatment of the",
  "primary  anti-imperialist  contradiction  and  the  secondary",
  "inner contradictions and tended to counterbalance the anti-",
  "imperialist struggle with the class or social struggle. They",
  "tend to see the national movement as a structured bourgeois",
  "movement, if not the bourgeoisie\u2019s movement, and miss its",
  "open ended and all-class character. Another noted Marxist",
  "historian, who made a critique of R.P. Dutt\u2019s paradigm, is",
  "Sumit Sarkar; he considers Dutt\u2019s paradigm as a \u201csimplistic",
  "version  of  the  Marxian  class  approach\u201d.  He  looks  at  the",
  "nationalist leaders in the light of intelligentsia which acts as",
  "a \u201ckind of proxy for as yet passive social forces with which",
  "it  had  little  organic  connection\u201d.",
  "A.R. Desai traces the growth of the national movement",
  "in five phases, each phase based on particular social classes",
  "which supported and sustained it.",
  "Subaltern  Approach/",
  "Historiography",
  "This school of thought began in the early 1980s under the",
  "editorship  of  Ranajit  Guha,  as  a  critique  of  the  existing",
  "historiography, which was faulted for ignoring the voice of",
  "the people. Right from the beginning, subaltern historiography",
  "took  the  position  that  the  entire  tradition  of  Indian",
  "historiography  had  had  an  elitist  bias.  For  the  subaltern",
  "historians, the basic contradiction in Indian society in the",
  "colonial epoch was between the elite, both Indian and foreign,",
  "on the one hand, and the subaltern groups, on the other, and",
  "not between colonialism and the Indian people. However, they",
  "do not subscribe to the Marxist theory of the nature of the",
  "exploitation by the nationalist movement: they point out that",
  "the Indian society of the time could not be seen in terms",
  "of class alone, as capitalism in the country was just nascent",
  "at the time. This school sees nationalism as exploitative in",
  "terms  of  caste,  gender,  religious  and  creed  divisions.",
  "Nationalism,  say  the  subalterns,  ignored  the  internalMajor Approaches to the History of Modern India \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 17",
  "View",
  "A few historians have of late initiated a new trend, described",
  "by its proponents as subaltern, which dismisses all previous",
  "historical writing, including that based on a Marxist perspective,",
  "as elite historiography, and claims to replace this old, \u2018blinkered\u2019",
  "historiography with what it claims is a new people\u2019s or subaltern",
  "approach.",
  "\u2014Bipan Chandra",
  "contradictions  within  the  society  as  well  as  what  the",
  "marginalised represented or had to say. They believe that the",
  "Indian people were never united in a common anti-imperialist",
  "struggle, that there was no such entity as the Indian national",
  "movement.  Instead,  they  assert,  there  were  two  distinct",
  "movements or streams: the real anti-imperialist stream of the",
  "subalterns and the bogus national movement of the elite. The",
  "elite streams, led by the \u2018official\u2019 leadership of the Indian",
  "National  Congress,  were  little  more  than  a  cloak  for  the",
  "struggle for power among the elite.",
  "Communalist  Approach",
  "The  historians  of  this  school,  relying  completely  on  the",
  "colonial historiography of medieval India and colonial era",
  "textbooks, viewed Hindus and Muslims as permanent hostile",
  "groups  whose  interests  were  mutually  different  and",
  "antagonistic to each other. This view was not only reflected",
  "in the writings of the historians but also took a more virulent",
  "form in the hands of the communal political leaders. In their",
  "view, India\u2019s medieval history was one long story of Hindu-",
  "Muslim conflict. As a corollary of this view, it was then",
  "argued  that  the  19th-  and  20th-century  Muslims  had  the",
  "\u2018happy\u2019 and \u2018proud\u2019 everpresent memory of having been the",
  "ruling class, while Hindus had the \u2018sad\u2019 and \u2018humiliating\u2019",
  "memory of having been the subject race. This, ultimately,",
  "developed mutual hatred among these groups often resulting",
  "in communal riots and, in the end led to the partition of",
  "India.18",
  "18 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Cambridge  School",
  "According  to  this  school  of  thought,  the  fundamental",
  "contradiction under colonial rule was not between imperialism",
  "and the Indian people, but among the Indians themselves.",
  "Further, Indian nationalism was not the product of a struggle",
  "of the Indian people against colonial exploitation, but what",
  "arose from conflict among the Indians for getting the benefits",
  "given to them by the British rulers. The leaders of the national",
  "movement, according to this school, were inspired by the",
  "quest for power and material benefits. This approach has been",
  "criticised by many scholars on the ground that it takes the",
  "mind or ideals out of human behaviour and reduces nationalism",
  "to \u2018animal politics\u2019.",
  "Liberal  and  Neo-Liberal",
  "Interpretations",
  "According to this interpretation, the economic exploitation",
  "of the colonies was not beneficial to the British people as",
  "a whole. The availability of markets for British industrial",
  "goods in the colonial world and capital investment in overseas",
  "markets (like laying of railways in India) might have actually",
  "discouraged domestic investment and delayed the development",
  "of the \u2018new\u2019 industries in Britain. The proponents of this",
  "school of thought are Patrick O\u2019Brian, Hopkins and Cain.",
  "Feminist  Historiography",
  "The shift in terms of the writing of women\u2019s history began",
  "with the women\u2019s movement of the 1970s which provided",
  "the  context  and  impetus  for  the  emergence  of  women\u2019s",
  "studies in India. Very soon, women\u2019s history broadened and",
  "assumed the more complex shape of gender history. In the",
  "early years, the endeavour was to write a history of women",
  "to supplement the writings of mainstream history. Also, an",
  "attempt  was  made  to  research  and  compile  an  archive  ofMajor Approaches to the History of Modern India \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 19",
  "women\u2019s writing. An important area of research has been",
  "analysis of the way in which colonial structures, such as the",
  "legal structure, affected women\u2019s lives. Women\u2019s vulnerability",
  "due to the denial of ownership of productive resources has",
  "been focused on, in the analysis of how progressive laws",
  "shaped gender relations. In the colonial period, two works",
  "based upon the women\u2019s question in India\u2014The High Caste",
  "Hindu Woman (1887) by Pandita Ramabai, and Mother India",
  "(1927) by Katherine Mayo\u2014attracted international attention.",
  "Summary",
  "Different Approaches",
  "Colonial Approach is influenced by the colonial ideology of",
  "domination. It focuses on criticism of indigenous society and",
  "culture, and praises the Western culture and values. James",
  "Mill, Vincent Smith etc., followed this approach.",
  "Nationalist Approach evolved as a response to and in confrontation",
  "with the colonial approach. Before independence, this school",
  "dealt with the ancient and medieval periods of Indian history,",
  "and not the modern period. After independence this school",
  "focused on modern India. R.C. Majumdar and Tara Chand",
  "belonged to this school.",
  "Marxist Approach focuses on the primary contradiction between",
  "the interests of the colonial masters and the native subjects.",
  "It also takes notice of the inner contradictions between the",
  "different sections of Indian society. R.P. Dutt and A.R. Desai",
  "were noted Marxist historians of India.",
  "Subaltern Approach takes the position that the entire tradition",
  "of Indian historiography has an elitist bias and the role of",
  "the common masses has been neglected. Ranajit Guha",
  "belonged to this school.",
  "Communalist Approach views Hindus and Muslims as permanently",
  "hostile groups whose interests are mutually different and",
  "antagonistic to each other.20",
  "20 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Cambridge School envisages Indian nationalism as a product",
  "of conflicts among the Indians themselves for getting the",
  "benefits from the British rulers. For them Indian nationalist",
  "leaders were inspired by the greed of power and material",
  "benefits.",
  "Liberal and Neo-liberal Interpretations imply that the economic",
  "exploitation of the colonies was not beneficial to the people",
  "of Britain as it delayed the development of the \u2018new\u2019 industries",
  "in Britain.",
  "Feminist  Historiography  focuses  on  areas  of  research  that",
