  " Raja Rammohan Roy and Brahmo Samaj",
  "Raja Rammohan Roy (1772-1833), often called the the father",
  "of Indian Renaissance and the maker of Modern India, was",
  "a man of versatile genius.",
  "Rammohan  Roy  believed  in  the  modern  scientific",
  "approach and principles of human dignity and social equality.",
  "He put his faith in monotheism. He wrote Gift to Monotheists",
  "(1809) and translated into Bengali the Vedas and the five",
  "Upanishads to prove his conviction that ancient Hindu texts",
  "support  monotheism.",
  "In 1814, he set up the Atmiya Sabha (or Society of",
  "Friends) in Calcutta to propagate the monotheistic ideals of",
  "the Vedanta and to campaign against idolatry, caste rigidities,",
  "meaningless rituals and other social ills. Strongly influenced",
  "by rationalist ideas, he declared that Vedanta is based on",
  "reason and that, if reason demanded it, even a departure from",
  "the  scriptures  is  justified.",
  "206Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 207",
  "He said the principles of rationalism applied to other",
  "sects also, particularly to the elements of blind faith in them.",
  "In  his  Precepts  of  Jesus  (1820),  he  tried  to  separate  the",
  "moral  and  philosophical  message  of  the  New  Testament,",
  "which he praised, from its miracle stories. He earned the",
  "wrath of missionaries over his advocacy to incorporate the",
  "message  of  Christ  into  Hinduism.",
  "He  stood  for  a  creative  and  intellectual  process  of",
  "selecting the best from different cultures, over which, again,",
  "he  faced  orthodox  reaction.",
  "Raja Rammohan Roy founded the Brahmo Sabha in",
  "August 1828; it was later renamed Brahmo Samaj. Through",
  "the Sabha he wanted to institutionalise his ideas and mission.",
  "The Samaj was committed to \u201cthe worship and adoration of",
  "the  Eternal,  Unsearchable,  Immutable  Being  who  is  the",
  "Author and Preserver of the Universe\u201d. Prayers, meditation",
  "and readings of the Upanishads were to be the forms of",
  "worship and no graven image, statue or sculpture, carving,",
  "painting, picture, portrait, etc., were to be allowed in the",
  "Samaj buildings, thus underlining the Samaj\u2019s opposition to",
  "idolatry and meaningless rituals. The long-term agenda of the",
  "Brahmo  Samaj\u2014to  purify  Hinduism  and  to  preach",
  "monotheism\u2014was based on the twin pillars of reason and",
  "the Vedas and Upanishads. The Samaj also tried to incorporate",
  "teachings of other religions and kept its emphasis on human",
  "dignity, opposition to idolatry and criticism of social evils",
  "such as sati.",
  "Rammohan Roy did not want to establish a new religion.",
  "He  only  wanted  to  purify  Hinduism  of  the  evil  practices",
  "which had crept into it. Roy\u2019s progressive ideas met with",
  "strong opposition from orthodox elements like Raja Radhakant",
  "Deb who organised the Dharma Sabha to counter Brahmo",
  "Samaj propaganda. Roy\u2019s death in 1833 was a setback for",
  "the Samaj\u2019s mission.",

  "The features of Brahmo Samaj may be summed thus\u2014",
  "it denounced polytheism and idol worship;",
  "\u25cf",
  "it discarded faith in divine avataras (incarnations);",
  "\u25cf",
  "it denied that any scripture could enjoy the status",
  "\u25cf",
  "of ultimate authority transcending human reason and",
  "conscience;",
  "it took no definite stand on the doctrine of karma",
  "\u25cf",
  "and transmigration of soul and left it to individual",
  "Brahmos to believe either way;",
  "it  criticised  the  caste  system.",
  "\u25cf",
  "His ideas and activities were also aimed at political",
  "uplift of the masses through social reform and, to that extent,",
  "can be said to have had nationalist undertones.",
  "Raja Rammohan Roy\u2019s Efforts at Social Reform",
  "Rammohan was a determined crusader against the inhuman",
  "practice of sati. He started his anti-sati struggle in 1818 and",
  "he cited sacred texts to prove his contention that no religion",
  "sanctioned the burning alive of widows, besides appealing to",
  "humanity,  reason  and  compassion.  He  also  visited  the",
  "cremation  grounds,  organised  vigilance  groups  and  filed",
  "counter  petitions  to  the  government  during  his  struggle",
  "against sati. His efforts were rewarded by the Government",
  "Regulation  in  1829  which  declared  the  practice  of  sati a",
  "crime.",
  "As a campaigner for women\u2019s rights, Roy condemned",
  "the general subjugation of women and opposed prevailing",
  "misconceptions  which  formed  the  basis  of  according  an",
  "inferior social status to women. Roy attacked polygamy and",
  "the  degraded  state  of  widows  and  demanded  the  right  of",
  "inheritance and property for women.",
  "Rammohan Roy did much to disseminate the benefits",
  "of modern education to his countrymen. He supported David",
  "Hare\u2019s efforts to found the Hindu College in 1817, while",
  "Roy\u2019s  English  school  taught  mechanics  and  Voltaire\u2019s",
  "philosophy. In 1825, he established a Vedanta college where",
  "courses  in  both  Indian  learning  and  Western  social  and",
  "physical sciences were offered. He also helped enrich the",
  "Bengali language by compiling a Bengali grammar book and",
  "evolving a modern elegant prose style.Survey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 209",
  "Views",
  "I regret to say that the present system of religion adhered to by",
  "the  Hindus  is  not  well  calculated  to  promote  their  political",
  "interests.... it is, I think, necessary that some change should take",
  "place  in  their  religion  at  least  for  the  sake  of  their  political",
  "advantage and social comfort.",
  "\u2014Raja Rammohan Roy",
  "Rammohan was a gifted linguist. He knew more than",
  "a dozen languages including Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, English,",
  "French, Latin, Greek and Hebrew. A knowledge of different",
  "languages helped him broadbase his range of study.",
  "As a bold supporter of freedom of the Press and as",
  "a pioneer in Indian journalism, Roy brought out journals in",
  "Bengali, Hindi, English, Persian to educate and inform the",
  "public and represent their grievances before the government.",
  "As  a  political  activist,  Roy  condemned  oppressive",
  "practices  of  Bengali  zamindars  and  demanded  fixation  of",
  "maximum rents. He also demanded abolition of taxes on tax-",
  "free  lands.  He  called  for  a  reduction  of  export  duties  on",
  "Indian goods abroad and abolition of the East India Company\u2019s",
  "trading  rights.  He  demanded  the  Indianisation  of  superior",
  "services and separation of the executive from the judiciary.",
  "He demanded judicial equality between Indians and Europeans",
  "and that trial be held by jury.",
  "Rammohan was an internationalist with a vision beyond",
  "his times. He stood for cooperation of thought and activity",
  "and  brotherhood  among  nations.  His  understanding  of  the",
  "universal character of the principles of liberty, equality and",
  "justice indicated that he well understood the significance of",
  "the modern age. He supported the revolutions of Naples and",
  "Spanish America and condemned the oppression of Ireland",
  "by absentee English landlordism and threatened emigration",
  "from the empire if the reform bill was not passed.",
  "Roy had David Hare, Alexander Duff, Debendranath",

  "Indian  learning  and  Western  thought,  gave  a  new  life  to",
  "Brahmo Samaj and a definite form and shape to the theist",
  "movement, when he joined the Samaj in 1842. Earlier, Tagore",
  "headed the Tattvabodhini Sabha (founded in 1839) which,",
  "along with its organ Tattvabodhini Patrika in Bengali, was",
  "devoted to the systematic study of India\u2019s past with a rational",
  "outlook and to the propagation of Rammohan\u2019s ideas. A new",
  "vitality and strength of membership came to be associated",
  "with the Brahmo Samaj due to the informal association of",
  "the two sabhas. Gradually, the Brahmo Samaj came to include",
  "prominent  followers  of  Rammohan,  the  Derozians  and",
  "independent thinkers such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and",
  "Ashwini Kumar Datta. Tagore worked on two fronts: within",
  "Hinduism,  the  Brahmo  Samaj  was  a  reformist  movement;",
  "outside, it resolutely opposed the Christian missionaries for",
  "their criticism of Hinduism and their attempts at conversion.",
  "The revitalised Samaj supported widow remarriage, women\u2019s",
  "education,  abolition  of  polygamy,  improvement  in  ryots\u2019",
  "conditions  and  temperance.",
  "Keshab Chandra Sen and the Brahmo Samaj",
  "The  Brahmo  Samaj  experienced  another  phase  of  energy,",
  "when  Keshab  Chandra  Sen  (1838-1884)  was  made  the",
  "acharya  by  Debendranath  Tagore  soon  after  the  former",
  "joined the Samaj in 1858. Keshab (also spelt Keshub) was",
  "instrumental in popularising the movement, and branches of",
  "the  Samaj  were  opened  outside  Bengal\u2014in  the  United",
  "Provinces,  Punjab,  Bombay,  Madras  and  other  towns.",
  "Unfortunately, Debendranath did not like some of Sen\u2019s ideas",
  "which he found too radical, such as cosmopolitanisation of",
  "the  Samaj\u2019s  meetings  by  inclusion  of  teachings  from  all",
  "religions and his strong views against the caste system, even",
  "open support to inter-caste marriages. Keshab Chandra Sen",
  "was  dismissed  from  the  office  of  acharya  in  1865.",
  "Keshab and his followers founded the Brahmo Samaj",

  "of India in 1866, while Debendranath Tagore\u2019s Samaj came",
  "to be known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj.",
  "In  1878,  Keshab\u2019s  inexplicable  act  of  getting  his",
  "thirteen-year-old  daughter  married  to  the  minor  Hindu",
  "Maharaja of Cooch-Behar with all the orthodox Hindu rituals",
  "caused another split in Keshab\u2019s Brahmo Samaj of India.",
  "Earlier, Keshab had begun to be considered as an incarnation",
  "by  some  of  his  followers,  much  to  the  dislike  of  his",
  "progressive  followers.  Further,  Keshab  had  begun  to  be",
  "accused  of  authoritarianism.",
  "After 1878, the disgusted followers of Keshab set up",
  "a  new  organisation,  the  Sadharan  Brahmo  Samaj.  The",
  "Sadharan Brahmo Samaj was started by Ananda Mohan Bose,",
  "Shibchandra Deb and Umesh Chandra Datta. It reiterated the",
  "Brahmo doctrines of faith in a Supreme being, one God, the",
  "belief  that  no  scripture  or  man  is  infallible,  belief  in  the",
  "dictates of reason, truth and morality.",
  "A number of Brahmo centres were opened in Madras",
  "province. In Punjab, the Dayal Singh Trust sought to implant",
  "Brahmo  ideas  by  the  opening  of  Dayal  Singh  College  at",
  "Lahore  in  1910.",
  "Significance  of  the  Brahmo  Samaj",
  "In matters of social reform, the Samaj attacked many dogmas",
  "and superstitions. It condemned the prevailing Hindu prejudice",
  "against going abroad. It worked for a respectable status for",
  "women in society\u2014condemned sati, worked for abolition of",
  "purdah system, discouraged child marriage and polygamy,",
  "crusaded  for  widow  remarriage  and  for  provisions  of",
  "educational  facilities.  It  also  attacked  casteism  and",
  "untouchability though in these matters it attained only limited",
  "success.",
  "The influence of the Brahmo Samaj, however, did not",
  "go much beyond Calcutta and, at most, Bengal. It did not have",
  "a lasting impact.",
  " Prarthana Samaj",
  "In 1867, Keshab Chandra Sen helped Atmaram Pandurang",
  "found the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay. Earlier, the Brahmo",
  "ideas spread in Maharashtra. A precursor of the Prarthana212 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Samaj was the Paramahansa Sabha, something like a secret",
  "society to spread liberal ideas and encourage the breakdown",
  "of caste and communal barriers. Mahadeo Govind Ranade",
  "(1842-1901),  joined  the  samaj  in  1870,  and  much  of  the",
  "popularity of and work done by the society was due to his",
  "efforts. His efforts made the samaj gain an all-India character.",
  "Other  leaders  of  the  samaj  were  R.G.  Bhandarkar  (1837-",
  "1925)  and  N.G.  Chandavarkar  (1855-1923).  The  emphasis",
  "was on monotheism, but on the whole, the samaj was more",
  "concerned  with  social  reforms  than  with  religion.  The",
  "Prarthana  Sabha  was  very  attached  to  the  bhakti  cult  of",
  "Maharashtra. The samaj relied on education and persuasion",
  "and  not on confrontation with Hindu orthodoxy. There was",
  "a  four-point  social  agenda  also:  (i)  disapproval  of  caste",
  "system, (ii) women\u2019s education, (iii) widow remarriage, and",
  "(iv) raising the age of marriage for both males and females.",
  "Dhondo Keshav Karve and Vishnu Shastri were champions",
  "of social reform with Ranade. Along with Karve, Ranade",
  "founded the Widow Remarriage Movement as well as Widows\u2019",
  "Home Association with the aim of providing education and",
  "training to widows so that they could support themselves.",
  "Young Bengal Movement and",
  "Henry Vivian Derozio",
  "During  the  late  1820s  and  early  1830s,  there  emerged  a",
  "radical, intellectual trend among the youth in Bengal, which",
  "came to be known as the \u2018Young Bengal Movement\u2019. A young",
  "Anglo-Indian, Henry Vivian Derozio (1809-31), who taught",
  "at the Hindu College from 1826 to 1831, was the leader and",
  "inspirer of this progressive trend. Drawing inspiration from",
  "the great French Revolution, Derozio inspired his pupils to",
  "think freely and rationally, question all authority, love liberty,",
  "equality  and  freedom,  and  oppose  decadent  customs  and",
  "traditions. The Derozians also supported women\u2019s rights and",
  "education.  Also,  Derozio  was  perhaps  the  first  nationalist",
  "poet of modern India.",
  "The  Derozians,  however,  failed  to  have  a  long-term",
  "impact. Derozio was removed from the Hindu College in",
  "1831 because of his radicalism. The main reason for their",
  "limited success was the prevailing social conditions at thatSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 213",
  "time, which were not ripe for the adoption of radical ideas.",
  "Further, there was no support from any other social group",
  "or class. The Derozians lacked any real link with the masses;",
  "for instance, they failed to take up the peasants\u2019 cause. In",
  "fact, their radicalism was bookish in character. But, despite",
  "their limitations, the Derozians carried forward Rammohan",
  "Roy\u2019s tradition of public education on social, economic and",
  "political questions. For instance, they demanded induction of",
  "Indians in higher grades of services, protection of ryots from",
  "oppressive  zamindars,  better  treatment  to  Indian  labour",
  "abroad in British colonies, revision of the Company\u2019s charter,",
  "freedom of press and trial by jury.",
  "Later,  Surendranath  Banerjea  was  to  describe  the",
  "Derozians  as  \u201cthe  pioneers  of  the  modern  civilisation  of",
  "Bengal, the conscript fathers of our race whose virtues will",
  "excite  veneration  and  whose  failings  will  be  treated  with",
  "gentlest  consideration\u201d.",
  " Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar",
  "The great scholar and reformer, Vidyasagar\u2019s ideas were a",
  "happy blend of Indian and Western thought. He believed in",
  "high moral values, was a deep humanist and was generous",
  "to the poor. In 1850, he became the principal of Sanskrit",
  "College. He was determined to break the priestly monopoly",
  "of scriptural knowledge, and for this he opened the Sanskrit",
  "College to non-brahmins. He introduced Western thought in",
  "Sanskrit  College  to  break  the  self-imposed  isolation  of",
  "Sanskritic learning. As an academician, he evolved a new",
  "methodology to teach Sanskrit. He also devised a new Bengali",
  "primer and evolved a new prose style.",
  "Vidyasagar started a movement in support of widow",
  "remarriage which resulted in legalisation of widow remarriage.",
  "He was also a crusader against child marriage and polygamy.",
  "He  did  much  for  the  cause  of  women\u2019s  education.  As",
  "government inspector of schools, he helped organise thirty-",
  "five girls\u2019 schools many of which he ran at his own expense.",
  "As  secretary  of  Bethune  School  (established  in  1849),  he",
  "was one of the pioneers of higher education for women in",
  "India.214 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "The Bethune School, founded in Calcutta, was the result",
  "of the powerful movement for women\u2019s education that arose",
  "in the 1840s and 1850s. The movement had to face great",
  "difficulties. The young students were shouted at and abused",
  "and,  sometimes,  even  their  parents  subjected  to  social",
  "boycott. Many believed that girls who had received Western",
  "education would make slaves of their husbands.",
  " Balshastri Jambhekar",
  "Balshastri Jambhekar (1812-1846) was a pioneer of social",
  "reform through journalism in Bombay; he attacked brahminical",
  "orthodoxy and tried to reform popular Hinduism. He started",
  "the  newspaper  Darpan  in  1832.  Known  as  the  father  of",
  "Marathi journalism, Jambhekar used the Darpan to awaken",
  "the people to awareness of social reforms, such as widow",
  "remarriage, and to instil in the masses a scientific approach",
  "to  life.  In  1840,  he  started  Digdarshan  which  published",
  "articles  on  scientific  subjects  as  well  as  history.",
  "Jambhekar founded the Bombay Native General Library",
  "and  started  the  Native  Improvement  Society  of  which  an",
  "offshoot was the Students Literary and Scientific Library. He",

  "Paramahansa Mandali\u2014Dadoba Pandurang, Mehtaji Durgaram",
  "and others\u2014began as a secret society that worked to reform",
  "Hindu religion and society in general. The ideology of the",
  "society  was  closely  linked  to  that  of  the  Manav  Dharma",
  "Sabha. Besides believing that one god should be worshipped,",
  "the society also said real religion is based on love and moral",
  "conduct.  Freedom  of  thought  was  encouraged  as  was",
  "rationality.  The  founders  of  the  mandali  were  primarily",
  "interested in breaking caste rules. At their meetings, food",
  "cooked by lower caste people was taken by the members.",
  "These mandalis also advocated widow remarriage and women\u2019s",
  "education.  Branches  of  Paramahansa  Mandali  existed  in",

  "Samaj (Truth Seekers\u2019 Society) in 1873, with the leadership",
  "of the samaj coming from the backward classes, malis, telis,",
  "kunbis, saris and dhangars. The main aims of the movement",
  "were (i) social service, and (ii) spread of education among",
  "women and lower caste people.",
  "Phule\u2019s works, Sarvajanik Satyadharma and Gulamgiri,",
  "became sources of inspiration for the common masses. Phule",
  "used the symbol of Rajah Bali as opposed to the brahmins\u2019",
  "symbol of Rama. Phule aimed at the complete abolition of",
  "the  caste  system  and  socio-economic  inequalities;  he  was",
  "against Sanskritic Hinduism. This movement gave a sense of",
  "identity to the depressed communities as a class against those",
  "brahmins who used religion and the blind faith of the masses",
  "to  exploit  the  masses  for  personal  monetary  gain.",
  "Phule, a firm believer in gender equality, was a pioneer",

  "interests  of  the  Indian  people;  and  to  prepare  a  cadre  of",
  "selfless workers who were to devote their lives to the cause",

  "Ever since its inception, the Mission has been running",
  "a number of schools, hospitals, dispensaries. It offers help",
  "to the afflicted in times of natural calamities like earthquakes,",
  "famines, floods and epidemics. The Mission has developed",
  "into a worldwide organisation. It is a deeply religious body,",
  "but it is not a proselytising body. It does not consider itself",
  "to be a sect of Hinduism. In fact, this is one of the strong",

  "was born in the old Morvi state in Gujarat in a brahmin family.",
  "He  wandered  as  an  ascetic  for  fifteen  years  (1845-60)  in",
  "search of truth. The first Arya Samaj unit was formally set",
  "up by him at Bombay in 1875 and later the headquarters of",
  "the Samaj were established at Lahore.",
  "Dayananda\u2019s views were published in his famous work,",
  "Satyarth Prakash (The True Exposition). His vision of IndiaSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 221",
  "included  a  classless  and  casteless  society,  a  united  India",
  "(religiously, socially and nationally), and an India free from",
  "foreign rule, with Aryan religion being the common religion",
  "of all. He took inspiration from the Vedas and considered",

  "Dayananda\u2019s slogan of \u2018Back to the Vedas\u2019 was a call",
  "for a revival of Vedic learning and Vedic purity of religion",
  "and not a revival of Vedic times. He accepted modernity and",
  "displayed a patriotic attitude to national problems.",
  "Dayananda had received education on Vedanta from a",
  "blind teacher named Swami Virajananda in Mathura. Along",
  "with  his  emphasis  on  Vedic  authority,  he  stressed  the",
  "significance of individual interpretation of the scriptures and",
  "said that every person has the right of access to God. He",
  "criticised later Hindu scriptures such as the Puranas and the",
  "ignorant  priests  for  perverting  Hinduism.",
  "Dayananda strongly criticised the escapist Hindu belief",
  "in  maya  (illusion)  as  the  running  theme  of  all  physical",
  "existence and the aim of human life as a struggle to attain",
  "moksha (salvation) through escape from this evil world to",
  "seek union with God. Instead, he advocated that God, soul",
  "and matter (prakriti) were distinct and eternal entities and",
  "every individual had to work out his own salvation in the light",
  "of the eternal principles governing human conduct. Thus he",
  "attacked the prevalent popular belief that every individual",
  "contributed  and  got  back  from  the  society  according  the",
  "principles  of  niyati  (destiny).  Dayananda  believed  in  the",
  "theory of karma and reincarnation. But he also said the good",
  "deeds should be primarily for the good of others and not",
  "for  self.",
  "Dayananda launched a frontal attack on Hindu orthodoxy,",

  "as  all-truth,  all-knowledge,  almighty,  immortal,  creator  of",
  "Universe, is alone worthy of worship; (iii) the Vedas are the",
  "books of true knowledge; (iv) an Arya should always be ready",
  "to accept truth and abandon untruth; (v) dharma, that is, due",

  "principle of all actions; (vi) the principal aim of the Samaj",
  "is to promote world\u2019s well-being in the material, spiritual",
  "and social sense; (vii) everybody should be treated with love",
  "and justice; (viii) ignorance is to be dispelled and knowledge",

  "of all others; (x) social well-being of mankind is to be placed",
  "above an individual\u2019s well-being.",

  "the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of Man, equality of",
  "the sexes, absolute justice and fair play between man and man",

  "But a difference of opinion between two groups in the samaj",
  "arose over the curriculum of the D.A.V. College. One group",
  "was known as the College Party (some sources say \u2018Culture\u2019",

  "Shraddhanand).  While  the  College  Party  favoured  the",
  "government  curriculum  and  English  education  to  meet",
  "economic and professional needs, the Mahatma Party was",
  "interested  in  introducing  the  study  of  Sanskrit  and  Vedic",
  "philosophy in the tradition of ancient gurukuls. Later, the",
  "issue of vegetarianism also became a point of contention:",
  "the  College  Party  had  nothing  against  non-vegetarianism,",
  "claiming  that  diet  was  a  personal  choice  and  it  was  not",
  "mentioned in the principles of the samaj; the Mahatma Party",
  "was in favour of all the Aryas being strict vegetarians. In the",
  "end the Arya Samaj split in 1893 over these issues.",
  "The  College  Party  retained  control  over  the  D.A.V.",
  "School and College, while the Arya Partinidhi Sabha, Punjab",
  "and a majority of the local Arya Samaj branches were taken",
  "over by the Mahatma Party. Swami Shraddhanand opened the",

  "Pakistan). In 1902, the Gurukul was moved to Kangri near",

  "at Jalandhar in 1896, and sponsored education for widows.",
  "The Arya Samaj was able to give self-respect and self-",

  "revivalist response to Western influences and the degeneration228 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "which had set in among Indian Muslims and called for a return",
  "to the true spirit of Islam. He was the first Indian Muslim",
  "leader of the 18th century to organise Muslims around the",
  "two-fold ideals of this movement: (i) desirability of harmony",
  "among the four schools of Muslim jurisprudence which had",
  "divided the Indian Muslims (he sought to integrate the best",
  "elements of the four schools); (ii) recognition of the role",
  "of  individual  conscience  in  religion  where  conflicting",
  "interpretations were derived from the Quran and the Hadis.",
  "The teachings of Walliullah were further popularised",
  "by Shah Abdul Aziz and Syed Ahmed Barelvi who also gave",
  "them a political perspective. Un-Islamic practices that had",
  "crept into Muslim society were sought to be eliminated. Syed",
  "Ahmed called for a return to the pure Islam and the kind",
  "of society that had existed in the Arabia of the Prophet\u2019s",
  "time. India was considered to be dar-ul-Harb (land of the",
  "kafirs) and it needed to be converted to dar-ul-Islam (land",
  "of Islam). Initially, the movement was directed at the Sikhs",
  "in Punjab but after the British annexation of Punjab (1849),",
  "the movement was directed against the British. During the",
  "1857  Revolt,  the  Wahabi\u2019s  played  an  important  role  in",
  "spreading anti-British feelings. The Wahabi Movement fizzled",
  "out in the face of British military might in the 1870s.",
  " Titu Mir\u2018s Movement",
  "Mir Nithar Ali, popularly known as Titu Mir, was a disciple",
  "of  Sayyid  Ahmed  Barelvi,  the  founder  of  the  Wahabi",
  "Movement. Titu Mir adopted Wahabism and advocated the",
  "Sharia. He organised the Muslim peasants of Bengal against",
  "the landlords, who were mosly Hindu, and the British indigo",
  "planters.The  movement  was  not  as  militant  as  the  British",
  "records made it out to be; only in the last year of  Titu\u2019s",
  "life was there a confrontation between him and the British",
  "police. He was killed in action in 1831.",
  " Faraizi Movement",
  "The movement, also called the Fara\u2019idi Movement because",
  "of its emphasis on the Islamic pillars of faith, was founded",
  "by Haji Shariatullah in 1818. Its scene of action was East",
  "Bengal, and it aimed at the eradication of social innovationsSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 229",
  "or un-Islamic practices current among the Muslims of the",
  "region and draw their attention to their duties as Muslims.",
  "Under the leadership of Haji\u2019s son, Dudu Mian, the movement",
  "became  revolutionary  from    1840  onwards.  He  gave  the",
  "movement an organisational system from the village to the",
  "provincial level with a khalifa or authorised deputy at every",
  "level. The Fara\u2019idis organised a paramilitary force  armed with",
  "clubs to fight the zamindars who were mostly Hindu, though",
  "there were some Muslim landlords too, besides the indigo",
  "planters. Dudu Mian asked his followers not to pay rent. The",
  "organisation even established its own Law courts.",
  "Dudu Mian was arrested several times, and his arrest",
  "in  1847  finally  weakened  the  movement.  The  movement",
  "survived merely as a religious movement without political",
  "overtones after the death of Dudu Mian in 1862.",
  " Ahmadiyya Movement",
  "The Ahmadiyya forms a sect of Islam which originated from",
  "India. It was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in 1889. It",
  "was  based  on  liberal  principles.  It  described  itself  as  the",
  "standard-bearer  of  Mohammedan  Renaissance,  and  based",
  "itself, like the Brahmo Samaj, on the principles of universal",
  "religion of all humanity, opposing jihad (sacred war against",
  "non-Muslims). The movement spread Western liberal education",
  "among the Indian Muslims. The Ahmadiyya community is the",
  "only Islamic sect to believe that the Messiah had come in",
  "the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to end religious wars",
  "and bloodshed and to reinstate morality, peace and justice.",
  "They believed in separating the mosque from the State as",
  "well as in human rights and tolerance. However, the Ahmadiyya",
  "Movement, like Baha\u2019ism which flourished in the West Asian",
  "countries,  suffered  from  mysticism.",
  " Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and the Aligarh",
  "Movement",
  "The British view on the revolt of 1857 held the Muslims",
  "to be the main conspirators. This view was further strengthened",
  "by the activities of the Wahabis. But later, an opinion got",
  "currency among the rulers that the Muslims could be used",
  "as allies against a rising tide of nationalist political activity230 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "represented, among others, by the foundation of the Indian",
  "National Congress. This was to be achieved  through offers",
  "of  thoughtful  concessions  to  the  Muslims.  A  section  of",
  "Muslims led by Syed Ahmed Khan (1817-1898) was ready",
  "to  allow  the  official  patronage  to  stimulate  a  process  of",
  "growth among Indian Muslims through better education and",
  "employment  opportunities.",
  "Syed  Ahmed  Khan,  born  in  a  respectable  Muslim",
  "family, was a loyalist member of the judicial service of the",
  "British government. After retirement in 1876, he became a",
  "member  of  the  Imperial  Legislative  Council  in  1878.  His",
  "loyalty  earned  him  a  knighthood  in  1888.  He  wanted  to",
  "reconcile Western scientific education with the teachings of",
  "the  Quran  which  were  to  be  interpreted  in  the  light  of",
  "contemporary rationalism and science even though he also",
  "held the Quran to be the ultimate authority. He said that",
  "religion  should  be  adaptable  with  time  or  else  it  would",
  "become  fossilised,  and  that  religious  tenets  were  not",
  "immutable. He advocated a critical approach and freedom of",
  "thought and not complete dependence on tradition or custom.",
  "He was also a zealous educationist\u2014as an official, he opened",
  "schools in towns, got books translated into Urdu and started",
  "the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College (later, the Aligarh",
  "Muslim University) at Aligarh in 1875. He also struggled to",
  "bring about an improvement in the position of women through",
  "better  education  and  by  opposing  purdah  and  polygamy,",
  "advocating easy divorce, and condemning the system of piri",
  "and muridi. He believed in the fundamental underlying unity",
  "of  religions  or  \u2018practical  morality\u2019.  He  also  preached  the",
  "basic commonality of Hindu and Muslim interests.",
  "Syed Ahmed Khan argued that Muslims should first",
  "concentrate on education and jobs and try to catch up with",
  "their Hindu counterparts who had gained the advantage of an",
  "early start. Active participation in politics at that point, he",
  "felt, would invite hostility of the government towards the",
  "Muslim masses. Therefore, he opposed political activity by",
  "the Muslims. Unfortunately, in his enthusiasm to promote",
  "the educational and employment interests of the Muslims,",
  "he allowed himself to be used by the colonial governmentSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 231",
  "in its obnoxious policy of divide and rule and, in later years,",
  "started  propagating  divergence  of  interests  of  Hindus  and",
  "Muslims.",
  "Syed\u2019s progressive social ideas were propagated through",
  "his magazine Tahdhib-ul-Akhlaq (Improvement of Manners",
  "and Morals).",
  "The Aligarh Movement emerged as a liberal, modern",
  "trend among the Muslim intelligentsia based in Mohammedan",
  "Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh. It aimed at spreading (i)",
  "modern education among Indian Muslims without weakening",
  "their allegiance to Islam; (ii) social reforms among Muslims",
  "relating to purdah, polygamy, widow remarriage, women\u2019s",
  "education, slavery, divorce, etc. The ideology of the followers",
  "of the movement was based on a liberal interpretation of the",
  "Quran  and  they  sought  to  harmonise  Islam  with  modern",
  "liberal culture. They wanted to impart a distinct socio-cultural",
  "identity to Muslims on modern lines. Soon, Aligarh became",
  "the centre of religious and cultural revival of the Muslim",
  "community.",
  " The Deoband School (Darul Uloom)",
  "The  Deoband  Movement  was  organised  by  the  orthodox",
  "section among the Muslim ulema as a revivalist movement",
  "with the twin objectives of propagating pure teachings of the",
  "Quran and Hadis among Muslims and keeping alive the spirit",
  "of  jihad  against  the  foreign  rulers.",
  "The Deoband Movement was begun at the Darul Uloom",
  "(or Islamic academic centre), Deoband, in Saharanpur district",
  "(United Provinces) in 1866 by Mohammad Qasim Nanotavi",
  "(1832-80) and Rashid Ahmed Gangohi (1828-1905) to train",
  "religious leaders for the Muslim community. In contrast to",
  "the  Aligarh  Movement,  which  aimed  at  the  welfare  of",
  "Muslims  through  Western  education  and  support  of  the",
  "British government, the aim of the Deoband Movement was",
  "moral and religious regeneration of the Muslim community.",
  "The instruction imparted at Deoband was in original Islamic",
  "religion.",
  "On the political front, the Deoband school welcomed",
  "the formation of the Indian National Congress and in 1888",
  "issued a fatwa (religious decree) against Syed Ahmed Khan\u2019s232 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "organisations,  the  United  Patriotic  Association  and  the",
  "Mohammaden  Anglo-Oriental  Association.  Some  critics",
  "attribute Deoband\u2019s support to the nationalists more to its",
  "determined  opposition  to  Syed  Ahmed  Khan  than  to  any",
  "positive  political  philosophy.",
  "Mahmud-ul-Hasan,  the  new  Deoband  leader,  gave  a",
  "political and intellectual content to the religious ideas of the",
  "school. He worked out a synthesis of Islamic principles and",
  "nationalist aspirations. The Jamiat-ul-Ulema gave a concrete",
  "shape  to  Hasan\u2019s  ideas  of  protection  of  the  religious  and",
  "political rights of the Muslims in the overall context of Indian",
  "unity and national objectives.",
  "Shibli  Numani,  a  supporter  of  the  Deoband  school,",
  "favoured  the  inclusion  of  English  language  and  European",
  "sciences in the system of education. He founded the Nadwatal",
  "Ulama and Darul Uloom in Lucknow in 1894-96. He believed",
  "in the idealism of the Congress and cooperation between the",
  "Muslims and the Hindus of India to create a state in which",
  "both could live amicably.",
  " Parsi Reform Movements",
  "The  Rahnumai  Mazdayasnan  Sabha  (Religious  Reform",
  "Association) was founded in 1851 by a group of English-",
  "educated Parsis for the \u201cregeneration of the social conditions",
  "of the Parsis and the restoration of the Zoroastrian religion",
  "to its pristine purity\u201d. The movement had Naoroji Furdonji,",
  "Dadabhai Naoroji, K.R. Cama and S.S. Bengalee as its leaders.",
  "The message of reform was spread by the newspaper Rast",
  "Goftar  (Truth-Teller).  Parsi  religious  rituals  and  practices",
  "were reformed and the Parsi creed redefined. In the social",
  "sphere,  attempts  were  made  to  uplift  the  status  of  Parsi",
  "women through removal of the purdah system, raising the",
  "age of marriage and education. Gradually, the Parsis emerged",
  "as  the  most  westernised  section  of  the  Indian  society.",
  " Sikh Reform Movements",
  "The  Sikh  community  could  not  remain  untouched  by  the",
  "rising tide of rationalist and progressive ideas of the nineteenth",
  "century.",
  "The Singh Sabha Movement was founded at Amritsar",
  "in  1873  with  a  two-fold  objective\u2014(i)  to  make  availableSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 233",
  "modern western education to the Sikhs, and (ii) to counter",
  "the proselytising activities of Christian missionaries as well",
  "as the Brahmo Samajists, Arya Samajists and Muslim maulvis.",
  "For  the  first  objective,  a  network  of  Khalsa  schools  was",
  "established by the Sabha throughout Punjab. In the second",
  "direction, everything that went against the Gurus\u2019 teachings",
  "was  rejected,  and  rites  and  customs  considered  to  be",
  "consistent with Sikh doctrine were sought to be established.",
  "The Akali movement (also known as Gurudwara Reform",
  "Movement) was an offshoot of the Singh Sabha Movement.",
  "It aimed at liberating the Sikh gurudwaras from the control",
  "of corrupt Udasi mahants (the post having become hereditary).",
  "These mahants were a loyalist and reactionary lot, enjoying",
  "government patronage. The government tried its repressive",
  "policies against the non-violent non-cooperation satyagraha",
  "launched by the Akalis in 1921, but had to bow before popular",
  "demands; it passed the Sikh Gurudwaras Act in 1922 (amended",
  "in 1925) which gave the control of gurudwaras to the Sikh",
  "masses  to  be  administered  through  Shiromani  Gurudwara",
  "Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) as the apex body.",
  "The Akali Movement was a regional movement but not",
  "a communal one. The Akali leaders played a notable role in",
  "the national liberation struggle though some dissenting voices",
  "were  heard  occasionally.",
  " The Theosophical Movement",
  "A group of westerners led by Madame H.P. Blavatsky (1831-",
  "1891) and Colonel M.S. Olcott, who were inspired by Indian",
  "thought  and  culture,  founded  the  Theosophical  Society  in",
  "New York City, United States in 1875. In 1882, they shifted",
  "their headquarters to Adyar, on the outskirts of Madras (at",
  "that  time)  in  India.  The  society  believed  that  a  special",
  "relationship could be established between a person\u2019s soul and",
  "God by contemplation, prayer, revelation, etc. It accepted the",
  "Hindu beliefs in reincarnation and karma, and drew inspiration",
  "from the philosophy of the Upanishads and samkhya, yoga",
  "and  Vedanta  schools  of  thought.  It  aimed  to  work  for",
  "universal  brotherhood  of  humanity  without  distinction  of",
  "race,  creed,  sex,  caste  or  colour.  The  society  also  sought",
  "to investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers234 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "latent in man. The Theosophical Movement came to be allied",
  "with the Hindu renaissance. (At one time it allied with the",
  "Arya Samaj too.) It opposed child marriage and advocated",
  "the  abolition  of  caste  discrimination,  uplift  of  outcastes,",
  "improvement in the condition of widows.",
  "In India, the movement became somewhat popular with",
  "the election of Annie Besant (1847-1933) as its president",
  "after the death of Olcott in 1907. Annie Besant had come",
  "to India in 1893. She laid the foundation of the Central Hindu",
  "College in Benaras in 1898 where both Hindu religion and",
  "Western scientific subjects were taught. The college became",
  "the nucleus for the formation of Benaras Hindu University",
  "in 1916. Annie Besant also did much for the cause of the",
  "education of women.",
  "The Theosophical Society provided a common denomi-",
  "nator for the various sects and fulfilled the urge of educated",
  "Hindus.  However,  to  an  average  Indian  the  Theosophist",
  "philosophy  seemed  to  be  vague  and  lacking  a  positive",
  "programme; to that extent its impact was limited to a small",
  "segment of the westernised class. As religious revivalists, the",
  "Theosophists did not attain much success, but as a movement",
  "of westerners glorifying Indian religious and philosophical",
  "traditions, it gave much needed self-respect to the Indians",
  "fighting British colonial rule. Viewed from another angle, the",
  "Theosophists also had the effect of giving a false sense of",
  "pride to the Indians in their outdated and sometimes backward-",
  "looking traditions and philosophy.",
  "Significance  of  Reform",
  "Movements",
  " Positive Aspects",
  "The  orthodox  sections  of  society  could  not  accept  the",
  "scientific ideological onslaught of the socio-religious rebels.",
  "As a result of this, the reformers were subjected to abuse,",
  "persecution, issuing of fatwas and even assassination attempts",
  "by  the  reactionaries.",
  "However,  in  spite  of  opposition,  these  movements",
  "managed to contribute towards the liberation of the individualSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 235",
  "from the conformity born out of fear and from uncritical",
  "submission to  exploitation by the priests and other classes.",
  "The translation of religious texts into vernacular languages,",
  "emphasis on an individual\u2019s right to interpret the scriptures",
  "and simplification of rituals made worship a more personal",
  "experience.",
  "The  movements  emphasised  the  human  intellect\u2019s",
  "capacity to think and reason.",
  "By weeding out corrupt elements, religious beliefs and",
  "practices, the reformers enabled their followers to meet the",
  "official taunt that their religions and society were decadent",
  "and  inferior.",
  "The reform movements gave the rising middle classes",
  "the much needed cultural roots to cling to, and served the",
  "purpose  of  reducing  the  sense  of  humiliation  which  the",
  "conquest by a foreign power had produced.",
  "A  realisation  of  the  special  needs  of  modern  times,",
  "especially in terms of scientific knowledge, and thus promoting",
  "a modern, this-worldly, secular and rational outlook was a",
  "major contribution of these reform movements. Socially, this",
  "attitude  reflected  in  a  basic  change  in  the  notions  of",
  "\u2018pollution and purity\u2019. Although traditional values and customs",
  "were a prominent target of attack from the reformers, yet",
  "the  reformers  aimed  at  modernisation  rather  than  outright",
  "westernisation  based  on  blind  imitation  of  alien  Western",
  "cultural  values.  In  fact,  the  reform  movements  sought  to",
  "create a favourable social climate for modernisation. To that",
  "extent, these movements ended India\u2019s cultural and intellectual",
  "isolation from the rest of the world. The reformers argued",
  "that  modern  ideas  and  culture  could  be  best  imbibed  by",
  "integrating them into Indian cultural streams.",
  "The underlying concern of these reformist efforts was",
  "revival  of  the  native  cultural  personality  which  had  got",
  "distorted  by  various  factors  over  the  years.  This  cultural",
  "ideological struggle was to prove to be an important instrument",
  "in the evolution of national consciousness and a part of Indian",
  "national  resolve  to  resist  colonial  cultural  and  ideological",
  "hegemony.  However,  not  all  these  progressive,  nationalist",
  "tendencies were able to outgrow the sectarian and obscurantist236 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "outlook. This was possibly due to the divergent duality of",
  "cultural  and  political  struggles,  resulting  in  cultural",
  "backwardness despite political advancement.",
  " Negative Aspects",
  "One  of  the  major  limitations  of  the  religious  reform",
  "movements was that they had a narrow social base, namely",
  "the educated and urban middle classes, while the needs of",
  "the vast masses of peasantry and the urban poor were ignored.",
  "The tendency of reformers to appeal to the greatness",
  "of the past and to rely on scriptural authority encouraged",
  "mysticism in new garbs and fostered pseudo-scientific thinking",
  "while exercising a check on the full acceptance of the need",
  "for  a  modern  scientific  outlook.  But,  above  all,  these",
  "tendencies  contributed,  at  least  to  some  extent,  in",
  "compartmentalising Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Parsis, as",
  "also alienating high caste Hindus from low caste Hindus.",
  "The emphasis on religious and philosophical aspects of",
  "the cultural heritage got somewhat magnified by an insufficient",
  "emphasis  on  other  aspects  of  culture\u2014art,  architecture,",
  "literature, music, science and technology. To make matters",
  "worse,  the  Hindu  reformers  confined  their  praise  of  the",
  "Indian past to its ancient period and looked upon the medieval",
  "period of Indian history essentially as an era of decadence.",
  "This tended to create a notion of two separate peoples, on",
  "the one hand; on the other, an uncritical praise of the past",
  "was not acceptable to the low caste sections of society which",
  "had suffered under religiously sanctioned exploitation during",
  "the ancient period. Moreover, the past itself tended to be",
  "placed into compartments on a partisan basis. Many in the",
  "Muslim middle classes went to the extent of turning to the",
  "history  of  West  Asia  for  their  traditions  and  moments  of",
  "pride.",
  "The process of evolution of a composite culture which",
  "was evident throughout Indian history showed signs of being",
  "arrested with the rise of another form of consciousness\u2014",
  "communal consciousness\u2014along with national consciousness",
  "among  the  middle  classes.",
  "Many other factors were certainly responsible for theSurvey of Socio-Cultural Reform Movements \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 237",
  "birth of communalism in modern times, but undoubtedly the",
  "nature of religious reform movements also contributed to it.",
  "On the whole, however, whatever the net outcome of",
  "these reform movements, it was out of this struggle that a",
  "new society evolved in India.",
