  "Congress Rule",
  "in Provinces",
  "Congress ministries were formed in Bombay, Madras, Central",
  "Provinces, Orissa, United Provinces, Bihar and later in the",
  "NWFP and Assam also.",
  "Gandhi\u2019s  Advice",
  "Gandhi advised Congressmen to hold these offices lightly and",
  "not tightly. The offices were to be seen as \u2018crowns of thorns\u2019",
  "which had been accepted to see if they quickened the pace",
  "towards the nationalist goal. Gandhi advised that these offices",
  "should be used in a way not expected or intended by the",
  "British.",
  "Gandhi urged Congressmen to prove that the Congress",
  "could rule with least assistance from the police and the Army.",
  "Work  under  Congress",
  "Ministries",
  "There was great enthusiasm among the people; suppressed",
  "mass energy had got released. There was an increase in the",
  "prestige of the Congress as it had showed that it could not",
  "only lead people but could also use State power for their",
  "benefit.  But  the  Congress  ministries  had  some  basic",
  "limitations:  they  could  not,  through  their  administration,",
  "change  the  basic  imperialist  character  of  the  system  and",
  "could not introduce a radical era.",

  "In the 28 months of Congress rule in the provinces,",
  "there  were  some  efforts  made  for  people\u2019s  welfare.",
  " Civil Liberties",
  "The  Congress  ministries  did  much  to  ease  curbs  on  civil",
  "liberties:",
  "Laws giving emergency powers were repealed.",
  "\u25cf",
  "Ban on illegal organisations, such as the Hindustan",
  "\u25cf",
  "Seva  Dal  and  Youth  Leagues,  and  on  certain  books  and",
  "journals was lifted.",
  "Press  restrictions  were  lifted.",
  "\u25cf",
  "Newspapers were taken out of black lists.",
  "\u25cf",
  "Confiscated arms and arms licences were restored.",
  "\u25cf",
  "Police  powers  were  curbed  and  the  CID  stopped",
  "\u25cf",
  "shadowing politicians.",
  "Political prisoners and revolutionaries were released,",
  "\u25cf",
  "and deportation and internment orders were revoked.",
  "In  Bombay  lands  confiscated  by  the  government",
  "\u25cf",
  "during  the  Civil  Disobedience  Movement  were  restored.",
  "Pensions  of  officials  associated  with  the  Civil",
  "\u25cf",
  "Disobedience  Movement  were  restored.",
  "But there were certain blemishes in the performance",
  "of  the  Congress  ministries  regarding  civil  liberties.  Yusuf",
  "Maherally, a socialist, was arrested by the Madras government",
  "for inflammatory speeches and later released. S.S. Batliwala,",
  "a  socialist,  was  arrested  by  the  Madras  government  for",
  "seditious speech and given a six months\u2019 sentence. Then,",
  "K.M.  Munshi,  the  Bombay  home  minister,  used  the  CID",
  "against  communists  and  leftists.",
  " Agrarian Reforms",
  "There  were  certain  basic  constraints  due  to  which  the",
  "Congress ministries could not undertake a complete overhaul",
  "of the agrarian structure by completely abolishing zamindari.",
  "These  constraints  were:",
  "(i) The ministries did not have adequate powers.",
  "(ii)  There  were  inadequate  financial  resources  as  a",
  "lion\u2019s share was appropriated by the Government of India.",
  "(iii) Strategy of class adjustments was another hurdle",
  "since zamindars, etc., had to be conciliated and neutralised.",
  "(iv) There was constraint of time since the logic ofCongress Rule in Provinces  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 413",
  "Congress politics was confrontation and not cooperation with",
  "colonialism.",
  "(v) War clouds had started hovering around 1938.",
  "(vi)  The  reactionary  second  chamber  (Legislative",
  "Council) dominated by landlords, moneylenders and capitalists",
  "in United Provinces, Bihar, Bombay, Madras and Assam had",
  "to be conciliated as its support was necessary for legislations.",
  "(vii) The agrarian structure was too complex.",
  "In spite of these constraints, the Congress ministries",
  "managed  to  legislate  a  number  of  laws  relating  to  land",
  "reforms, debt relief, forest grazing fee, arrears of rent, land",
  "tenures,  etc.",
  "But  most  of  these  benefits  went  to  statutory  and",
  "occupancy  tenants  while  sub-tenants  did  not  gain  much.",
  "Agricultural labourers did not benefit as they had not been",
  "mobilised.",
  " Attitude Towards Labour",
  "The basic approach was to advance workers\u2019 interests while",
  "promoting industrial peace. This was sought to be achieved",
  "by  reducing  strikes  as  far  as  possible  and  by  advocating",
  "compulsory arbitration prior to striking before the established",
  "conciliation machinery. Goodwill was sought to be created",
  "between  labour  and  capital  with  mediation  of  ministries,",
  "while  at  the  same  time  efforts  were  made  to  improve",
  "workers\u2019 condition and secure wage increases for them.",
  "The ministries treated militant trade union protests as",
  "law and order problems, and acted as mediators as far as",
  "possible. This approach was largely successful but not so in",
  "Bombay.  Also,  leftist  critics  were  not  satisfied  by  this",
  "approach. Generally, the ministries took recourse to Section",
  "144  and  arrested  the  leaders.",
  "Nehru was unhappy about these repressive measures,",
  "but in public supported the ministries to protect them from",
  "petty and petulant criticism. Although Gandhi was against",
  "militant and violent methods, he stood for political education",
  "of the masses. He felt that the popular base of the Congress",
  "should  not  erode.  He  appealed  to  Congressmen  against",
  "frequent resort to colonial laws and machinery.414 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  " Social Welfare Reforms",
  "These included the following\u2014",
  "Prohibition  imposed  in  certain  areas.",
  "\u25cf",
  "Measures  for  welfare  of  Harijans  taken\u2014temple",
  "\u25cf",
  "entry, use of public facilities, scholarships, an increase in",
  "their numbers in government service and police, etc.",
  "Attention  given  to  primary,  technical  and  higher",
  "\u25cf",
  "education and to public health and sanitation.",
  "Encouragement given to khadi through subsidies and",
  "\u25cf",
  "other  measures.",
  "Prison  reforms  undertaken.",
  "\u25cf",

  "\u25cf",
  "Planning Committee set up under Congress president Subhash",
  "Bose  in  1938.",
  "Extra-Parliamentary  Mass  Activity  of  Congress",
  "Such activities included\u2014",
  "launching of mass literacy campaigns,",
  "\u25cf",
  "setting up of Congress police stations and panchayats,",
  "\u25cf",
  "Congress  Grievance  Committees  presenting  mass",

  "petitions to government, and",

  "\u25cf",
  "Evaluation",
  "Though by 1939 internal strifes, opportunism and hunger for",
  "power had started surfacing among Congressmen, yet they",
  "were able to utilise council work to their advantage to a great",
  "extent. The 28-month Congress rule was also significant for",
  "the  following  reasons.",
  "The  contention  that  Indian  self-government  was",
  "\u25cf",
  "necessary  for  radical  social  transformation  got  confirmed.",
  "Congressmen demonstrated that a movement could",
  "\u25cf",
  "use state power to further its ends without being co-opted.",
  "The ministries were able to control communal riots.",
  "\u25cf",
  "The morale of the bureaucracy came down.",
  "\u25cf",
  "Council work helped neutralise many erstwhile hostile",
  "\u25cf",
  "elements  (landlords,  etc).",
  "People were able to perceive the shape of things to",
  "\u25cf",
  "come if independence was won.Congress Rule in Provinces  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 415",
  "Administrative work by Indians further weakened the",
  "\u25cf",
  "myth that Indians were not fit to rule.",
  "The  Congress  ministries  resigned  in  October  1939",
  "after the outbreak of the Second World War.",
  "The huge Congress victory in the elections had aroused",
  "the hopes of the industrial working class; there was increased",
  "militancy and industrial unrest in Bombay, Gujarat, the United",
  "Provinces and Bengal at a time when the Congress was drawn",
  "into a closer friendship with Indian capitalists. This resulted",
  "in  what  appeared  to  be  an  anti-labour  shift  in  Congress",
  "attitudes that led to the Bombay Traders Disputes Act in",
  "1938. The Congress leadership was also faced with another",
  "dilemma: how to react to the situation in the princely states\u2014",
  "should the Congress support the Prajamandal movement for",
  "greater  democracy  or  not.",
  "In the meanwhile, the All India Muslim League, annoyed",
  "with the Congress for not sharing power with them established",
  "the Pirpur Committee in 1938 to prepare a detailed report",
  "on  the  atrocities  supposedly  committed  by  the  Congress",
  "ministries. In its report the committee charged the Congress",
  "with interference in the religious rites, suppression of Urdu",
  "in favour of Hindi, denial of proper representation and of",
  "the  oppression  of  Muslims  in  the  economic  sphere.",
  "The Congress was forced to realise that being in power",
  "and actually running the administration was not easy, and all",
  "sections of populations had such high expectations as could",
  "not be fulfilled all at once.",
