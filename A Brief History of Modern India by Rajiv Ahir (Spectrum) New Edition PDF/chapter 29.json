  "Development of",
  "Indian Press",
  "James Augustus Hickey in 1780 started The Bengal Gazette",
  "or Calcutta General Advertiser, the first newspaper in India,",
  "which was seized in 1872 because of its outspoken criticism",
  "of  the  Government.  Later  more  newspapers/journals  came",
  "up\u2014The  Bengal  Journal,  The  Calcutta  Chronicle,  The",
  "Madras  Courier,  The  Bombay  Herald.  The  Company\u2019s",
  "officers  were  worried  that  these  newspapers  might  reach",
  "London and expose their misdeeds. Thus they saw the need",
  "for  curbs  on  the  press.",
  "Early  Regulations",
  "Censorship  of  Press  Act,  1799",
  "Lord Wellesley enacted this, anticipating French invasion of",
  "India. It imposed almost wartime press restrictions including",
  "pre-censorship. These restrictions were relaxed under Lord",
  "Hastings,  who  had  progressive  views,  and  in  1818,  pre-",
  "censorship was dispensed with.",
  "Licensing  Regulations,  1823",
  "The acting governor-general, John Adams, who had reactionary",
  "views, enacted these. According to these regulations, starting",
  "or using a press without licence was a penal offence. Later",
  "on, the Act was extended to cover journals, pamphlets and",
  "books. These restrictions were directed chiefly against Indian",
  "language newspapers or those edited by Indians. Rammohan",
  "Roy\u2019s  Mirat-ul-Akbar  had  to  stop  publication.",

  "Press  Act  of  1835  or  Metcalfe  Act",
  "Metcalfe  (governor-general\u20141835-36)  repealed  the",
  "obnoxious 1823 ordinance and earned the epithet, \u201cliberator",
  "of the Indian press\u201d. The new Press Act (1835) required a",
  "printer/publisher to give a precise account of premises of",
  "a publication and cease functioning, if required by a similar",
  "declaration.",
  "The result of a liberal press policy was a rapid growth",
  "of newspapers.",
  "Licensing  Act,  1857",
  "Due to the emergency caused by the 1857 revolt, this Act",
  "imposed  licensing  restrictions  in  addition  to  the  already",
  "existing registration procedure laid down by Metcalfe Act",
  "and the government reserved the right to stop publication and",
  "circulation of any book, newspaper or printed matter.",
  "Registration  Act,  1867",
  "This replaced Metcalfe\u2019s Act of 1835 and was of a regulatory,",
  "not  restrictive,  nature.  As  per  the  Act,  (i)  every  book/",
  "newspaper was required to print the name of the printer and",
  "the publisher and the place of the publication; and (ii) a copy",
  "was  to  be  submitted  to  the  local  government  within  one",
  "month of the publication of a book.",
  "Struggle  by  Early  Nationalists",
  "to  Secure  Press  Freedom",
  "Right  from  the  early  nineteenth  century,  defence  of  civil",
  "liberties, including the freedom of the press, had been high",
  "on nationalist agenda. As early as 1824, Raja Rammohan Roy",
  "had protested against a resolution restricting the freedom of",
  "the  press.",
  "The early phase of nationalist movement from around",
  "1870  to  1918  focussed  more  on  political  propaganda  and",
  "education, formation and propagation of nationalist ideology",
  "and  arousing,  training,  mobilisation  and  consolidation  of",
  "public opinion, than on mass agitation or active mobilisation",
  "of masses through open meetings. For this purpose the press",
  "proved a crucial tool in the hands of the nationalists. The",
  "Indian National Congress in its early days relied solely on",
  "the  press  to  propagate  its  resolutions  and  proceedings.",
  "Many newspapers emerged during these years under",
  "distinguished  and  fearless  journalists.  These  included  The",
  "Hindu and Swadesamitran under G. Subramaniya Aiyar, TheDevelopment of Indian Press  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 559",
  "Bengalee under Surendranath Banerjea, Voice of India under",
  "Dadabhai Naoroji, Amrita Bazar Patrika under Sisir Kumar",
  "Ghosh and Motilal Ghosh, Indian Mirror under N.N. Sen,",
  "Kesari  (in  Marathi)  and  Maharatta  (in  English)  under",
  "Balgangadhar Tilak, Sudharak under Gopal Ganesh Agarkar,",
  "and Hindustan and Advocate under G.P. Verma. Other main",
  "newspapers included, Tribune and Akbhar-i-am  in  Punjab,",
  "Gujarati, Indu Prakash, Dhyan Prakash and Kal in Bombay",
  "and  Som  Prakash,  Banganivasi  and  Sadharani  in  Bengal.",
  "These  newspapers  were  not  established  as  profit-",
  "making business ventures but were seen as rendering national",
  "and public service. In fact, these newspapers had a wide reach",
  "and they stimulated a library movement. Their impact was",
  "not limited to cities and towns; these newspapers reached",
  "the  remote  villages,  where  each  news  item  and  editorial",
  "would be read and discussed thoroughly in the \u2018local libraries\u2019",
  "which would gather around a single newspaper. In this way,",
  "these  libraries  served  the  purpose  of  not  only  political",
  "education  but  also  of  political  participation.  In  these",
  "newspapers, government Acts and policies were put to critical",
  "scrutiny. They acted as an institution of opposition to the",
  "government.",
  "The government on its part had enacted many strident",
  "laws, such as Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code which",
  "provided that anyone trying to cause disaffection against the",
  "British Government in India was to be transported for life",
  "or for any term or imprisoned up to three years. But the",
  "nationalist-minded  journalists  had  evolved  many  clever",
  "strategems  to  subvert  these  legal  hurdles.  For  instance,",
  "writings hostile to the government used to be prefaced with",
  "sentiments of loyalty to the government or critical writings",
  "of socialists or Irish nationalists from newspapers in England",
  "used to be quoted. This was a difficult task which required",
  "an intelligent mix of simplicity with subtlety.",
  "The national movement, from its very beginning, stood",
  "for  the  freedom  of  press.  The  Indian  newspapers  became",
  "highly  critical  of  Lord  Lytton\u2019s  administration  especially",
  "regarding its inhuman treatment to victims of the famine of",
  "1876-77. The Government struck back with the Vernacular",
  "Press  Act,  1878.",
  "Vernacular  Press  Act,  1878",
  "A bitter legacy of the 1857 revolt was the racial bitterness",
  "between the ruler and the ruled. After 1858, the European560 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "press  always  rallied  behind  the  government  in  political",
  "controversies while the vernacular press was critical of the",
  "government. There was a strong public opinion against the",
  "imperialistic  policies  of  Lytton,  compounded  by  terrible",
  "famine (1876-77), on the one hand, and lavish expenditure",
  "on the imperial Delhi Durbar, on the other.",
  "The  Vernacular  Press  Act  (VPA)  was  designed  to",
  "\u2018better control\u2019 the vernacular press and effectively punish",
  "and  repress  seditious  writing.  The  provisions  of  the  Act",
  "included the following.",
  "1. The district magistrate was empowered to call upon",
  "the printer and publisher of any vernacular newspaper to enter",
  "into a bond with the government undertaking not to cause",
  "disaffection  against  the  government  or  antipathy",
  "between persons of different religions, caste, race through",
  "published material; the printer and publisher could also be",
  "required to deposit security which could be forefeited if the",
  "regulation were contravened, and press equipment could be",
  "seized  if  the  offence  re-occurred.",
  "2. The magistrate\u2019s action was final and no appeal could",
  "be made in a court of law.",
  "3. A vernacular newspaper could get exemption from",
  "the operation of the Act by submitting proofs to a government",
  "censor.",
  "The Act came to be nicknamed \u201cthe gagging Act\u201d. The",
  "worst features of this Act were\u2014(i) discrimination between",
  "English and vernacular press, (ii) no right of appeal.",
  "Under VPA, proceedings were instituted against Som",
  "Prakash,  Bharat  Mihir,  Dacca  Prakash  and  Samachar.",
  "(Incidentally, the Amrita Bazar Patrika turned overnight",
  "into an English newspaper to escape the VPA.)",
  "Later, the pre-censorship clause was repealed, and a",
  "press commissioner was appointed to supply authentic and",
  "accurate news to the press.",
  "There  was  strong  opposition  to  the  Act  and  finally",
  "Ripon  repealed  it  in  1882.",
  "In  1883,  Surendranath  Banerjea  became  the  first",
  "Indian journalist to be imprisoned. In an angry editorial",
  "in The Bengalee Banerjea had criticised a judge of Calcutta",
  "High Court for being insensitive to the religious sentiments",
  "of Bengalis in one of his judgements.",
  "Bal Gangadhar Tilak is most frequently associated with",
  "the nationalist fight for the freedom of press. Tilak had beenDevelopment of Indian Press  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 561",
  "building  up  anti-imperialist  sentiments  among  the  public",
  "through Ganapati festivals (started in 1893), Shivaji festivals",
  "(started  in  1896)  and  through  his  newspapers  Kesari  and",
  "Maharatta. He was among the first to advocate bringing the",
  "lower middle classes, the peasants, artisans and workers into",
  "the Congress fold. In 1896, he organised an all Maharashtra",
  "campaign  for  boycott  of  foreign  cloth  in  opposition  to",
  "imposition of excise duty on cotton. In 1896-97 he initiated",
  "a no-tax campaign in Maharashtra, urging farmers to withhold",
  "the payment of revenue if their crop had failed. In 1897,",
  "plague  occurred  in  Poona.  Although  Tilak  supported",
  "government measures to check plague, there was large-scale",
  "popular resentment against heartless and harsh methods such",
  "as  segregation  and  house  searches.  The  popular  unrest",
  "resulted in murder of the chairman of the Plague Committee",
  "in Poona by the Chapekar brothers. The government policies",
  "on tariff, currency and famine were also behind this popular",
  "resentment.",
  "The government had been looking for an opportunity",
  "to check this militant trend and hostility in the press. They",
  "decided to make Tilak a victim to set an example to the",
  "public. Tilak was arrested after the murder of Rand on the",
  "basis of the publication of a poem, \u2018Shivaji\u2019s Utterances\u2019, in",
  "Kesari, and a speech which Tilak had delivered at the Shivaji",
  "festival, justifying Afzal Khan\u2019s murder by Shivaji. Tilak\u2019s",
  "defence of Shivaji\u2019s killing of Afzal Khan was portrayed by",
  "the prosecution as an incitement to kill British officials. Tilak",
  "was  held  guilty  and  awarded  rigorous  imprisonment  of",
  "eighteen  months.  Simultaneously  several  other  editors  in",
  "Bombay  presidency  were  tried  and  given  similar  harsh",
  "sentences.  There  were  widespread  protests  against  these",
  "measures. Overnight Tilak became a national hero and was",
  "given the title of \u2018Lokmanya\u2019 (respected and honoured by the",
  "people)\u2014a new leader who preached with his deeds.",
  "In 1898, the government amended Section 124A and",
  "added another Section 153A which made it a criminal offence",
  "for anyone to bring into contempt the Government of India",
  "or to create hatred among different classes, that is, vis-a-",
  "vis the English in India. This also led to nation-wide protests.",
  "During Swadeshi and Boycott Movements and due to rise of",
  "militant  nationalist  trends,  several  repressive  laws  were",
  "passed.562 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",

  "The government has converted the entire nation into a prison",
  "and we are all prisoners. Going to prison only means that from",
  "a big cell one is confined to a smaller one.",
  "Bal Gangadhar Tilak",
  "Newspaper (Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908 Aimed",
  "against Extremist nationalist activity, the Act empowered the",
  "magistrates  to  confiscate  press  property  which  published",
  "objectionable material likely to cause incitement to murder/",
  "acts  of  violence.",
  "Tilak as the leader of militant nationalists was tried on",
  "charges of sedition and transported to Mandalay (Burma) for",
  "six years. This led to countrywide protests. In Bombay, textile",
  "workers and railway workshop workers took on the Army in",
  "streets and went on strike for days. Lenin hailed this as the",
  "entrance of the Indian working class on the political stage.",
  "Indian Press Act, 1910 This Act revived the worst",
  "features of the VPA\u2014local government was empowered to",
  "demand a security at registration from the printer/publisher",
  "and fortfeit/deregister if it was an offending newspaper, and",
  "the printer of a newspaper was required to submit two copies",
  "of  each  issue  to  local  government  free  of  charge.",
  "During  and  After  the",
  "First  World  War",
  "Defence  of  India  Rules  were  imposed  for  repression  of",
  "political agitation and free public criticism during the First",
  "World War. In 1921, on the recommendations of a Press",
  "Committee chaired by Tej Bahadur Sapru, the Press Acts of",
  "1908  and  1910  were  repealed.",
  "Indian  Press  (Emergency  Powers)  Act,  1931  This",
  "Act  gave  sweeping  powers  to  provincial  governments  to",
  "suppress propaganda for Civil Disobedience Movement. It",
  "was  further  amplified  in  1932  to  include  all  activities",
  "calculated to undermine government authority.",
  "During  the  Second  World  War",
  "Under  the  Defence  of  India  Rules,  pre-censorship  was",
  "imposed and amendments made in Press Emergency Act and",
  "Official Secrets Act. At one time, publication of all news",
  "related to Congress activity was declared illegal.",
