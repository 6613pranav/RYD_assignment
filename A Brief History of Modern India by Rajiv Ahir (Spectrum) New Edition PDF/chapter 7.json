  "The Revolt of 1857",
  "In 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, the British laid the first",
  "step towards getting power in northern India. And in 1857",
  "took place the major \u2018Revolt\u2019 which was a product of the",
  "character and policies of colonial rule after 1757, and after",
  "which noteworthy changes took place in the British policy",
  "of ruling over India.",
  "  Simmering  Discontent",
  "The  cumulative  effect  of  British  expansionist  policies,",
  "economic  exploitation  and  administrative  innovations  over",
  "the years had adversely affected the positions of all\u2014rulers",
  "of Indian states, sepoys, zamindars, peasants, traders, artisans,",
  "pundits, maulvis, etc. The simmering discontent burst in the",
  "form of a violent storm in 1857 which shook the British",
  "empire in India to its very foundations.",
  "However, the period between 1757 and 1857 was not",
  "all  peaceful  and  trouble-free;  it  saw  a  series  of  sporadic",
  "popular outbursts in the form of religio-political violence,",
  "tribal movements, peasant uprisings and agrarian riots, and",
  "civil rebellions. Enhanced revenue demands\u2014even in famine",
  "years\u2014caused anger. Many a times, movements against local",
  "moneylenders turned into rebellion against the Company rule",
  "as the moneylenders had the support of the police. British",
  "interference in native religious/traditional customs also caused",
  "167168 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "resentment and resulted in rebellions. Almost from the very",
  "early days of the East India Company\u2019s rule, rebellions and",
  "uprisings  occurred  for  various  causes  in  different  regions.",
  "Some  of  the  movements  continued  even  after  the  1857",
  "Revolt. Major revolts took place in the south, east, west and",
  "the north-eastern regions which were suppressed with brutality",
  "by the Company.",
  "[The previous chapter discussed some of these uprisings.]",
  "  The  1857  Revolt:  the",
  "Major  Causes",
  "The  causes  of  the  revolt  of  1857,  like  those  of  earlier",
  "uprisings, emerged from all aspects\u2014socio-cultural, economic",
  "and political\u2014of daily existence of Indian population cutting",
  "through all sections and classes. These causes are discussed",
  "below.",
  " Economic Causes",
  "The colonial policies of the East India Company destroyed",
  "the traditional economic fabric of the Indian society. The",
  "peasantry were never really to recover from the disabilities",
  "imposed by the new and a highly unpopular revenue settlement.",
  "Impoverished  by  heavy  taxation,  the  peasants  resorted  to",
  "loans from money-lenders/traders at usurious rates, the latter",
  "often evicting the former from their land on non-payment",
  "of debt dues. These money-lenders and traders emerged as",
  "the new landlords, while the scourge of landless peasantry",
  "and rural indebtedness has continued to plague Indian society",
  "to this day. The older system of zamindari was forced to",
  "disintegrate.",
  "British  rule  also  meant  misery  to  the  artisans  and",
  "handicrafts people. The annexation of Indian states by the",
  "Company cut off their major source of patronage\u2014the native",
  "rulers and the nobles, who could not now afford to be patrons",
  "of the crafts workers. Added to this, British policy discouraged",
  "Indian handicrafts and promoted British goods. The highly",
  "skilled Indian craftsmen were forced to look for alternate",
  "sources of employment that hardly existed, as the destruction",
  "of Indian handicrafts was not accompanied by the development",
  "of  modern  industries.The Revolt of 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 169",
  "View",
  "It was the British intruder who broke up the Indian handloom",
  "and destroyed the spinning-wheel. England began with depriving",
  "the Indian cottons from the European market; it then introduced",
  "twist into Hindustan and in the end inundated the very mother",
  "country of cotton with cottons.\u201d",
  "\u2014Karl Marx, in 1853",
  "The Indian trade and mercantile class was deliberately",
  "crippled by the British who imposed high tariff duties on",
  "Indian-made goods. At the same time, the import of British",
  "goods into India attracted low tariffs, thus encouraging their",
  "entry into India. By mid-nineteenth century, exports of cotton",
  "and silk textiles from India practically came to an end. Free",
  "trade\u2014one way, that is\u2014and refusal to impose protective",
  "duties  against  machine-made  goods  from  Britain  simply",
  "killed Indian manufacture.",
  "Zamindars, the traditional landed aristocracy, often saw",
  "their  land  rights  forfeited  with  frequent  use  of  a  quo",
  "warranto by the administration. This resulted in a loss of",
  "status for them in the villages. In Awadh, the storm centre",
  "of the revolt, 21,000 taluqdars had their estates confiscated",
  "and suddenly found themselves without a source of income,",
  "\u201cunable to work, ashamed to beg, condemned to penury\u201d.",
  "These dispossessed taluqdars seized the opportunity presented",
  "by the sepoy revolt to oppose the British and try to regain",
  "what they had lost.",
  "The ruin of Indian industry increased the pressure on",
  "agriculture and land, which could not support all the people;",
  "the  lopsided  development  resulted  in  pauperisation  of  the",
  "country in general.",
  " Political Causes",
  "The East India Company\u2019s greedy policy of aggrandisement",
  "accompanied  by  broken  pledges  and  promises  resulted  in",
  "contempt  for  the  Company  and  loss  of  political  prestige,",
  "besides  causing  suspicion  in  the  minds  of  almost  all  the",
  "ruling princes in India, through such policies as of \u2018Effective",
  "Control\u2019, \u2018Subsidiary Alliance\u2019 and \u2018Doctrine of Lapse\u2019. The",
  "right of succession was denied to Hindu princes. The Mughals",
  "were humbled when, on Prince Faqiruddin\u2019s death in 1856,",
  "whose succession had been recognised conditionally by Lord",
  "Dalhousie, Lord Canning announced that the next prince on170 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "succession would have to renounce the regal title and the",
  "ancestral  Mughal  palaces,  in  addition  to  the  renunciations",
  "agreed upon by Prince Faqiruddin.",
  "The collapse of rulers\u2014the erstwhile aristocracy\u2014also",
  "adversely affected those sections of the Indian society which",
  "derived their sustenance from cultural and religious pursuits.",
  " Administrative Causes",
  "Rampant  corruption  in  the  Company\u2019s  administration,",
  "especially among the police, petty officials and lower law",
  "courts, was a major cause of discontent. Indeed, it is the view",
  "of many historians that the rampant corruption we see now",
  "in India is a legacy of the Company rule. Also, the character",
  "of British rule imparted a foreign and alien look to it in the",
  "eyes of Indians: a kind of absentee sovereignty.",
  " Socio-Religious Causes",
  "Racial overtones and a superiority complex characterised the",
  "British  administrative  attitude  towards  the  native  Indian",
  "population.  The  activities  of  Christian  missionaries  who",
  "followed the British flag in India were looked upon with",
  "suspicion by Indians. The attempts at socio-religious reform",
  "such  as  abolition  of  sati,  support  to  widow-marriage  and",
  "women\u2019s  education  were  seen  by  a  large  section  of  the",
  "population as interference in the social and religious domains",
  "of Indian society by outsiders. These fears were compounded",
  "by the government\u2019s decision to tax mosque and temple lands",
  "and making laws such as the Religious Disabilities Act, 1856,",
  "which modified Hindu customs, for instance, declaring that",
  "a change of religion did not debar a son from inheriting the",
  "property of his \u2018heathen\u2019 father.",
  " Influence of Outside Events",
  "The revolt of 1857 coincided with certain outside events in",
  "which the British suffered serious losses\u2014the First Afghan",
  "War  (1838-42),  Punjab  Wars  (1845-49),  and  the  Crimean",
  "Wars  (1854-56).  These  had  obvious  psychological",
  "repercussions. The British were seen to be not so strong and",
  "it was felt that they could be defeated.",
  " Discontent Among Sepoys",
  "The  conditions  of  service  in  the  Company\u2019s  Army  and",
  "cantonments increasingly came into conflict with the religiousThe Revolt of 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 171",
  "beliefs and prejudices of the sepoys. Restrictions on wearing",
  "caste and sectarian marks and secret rumours of proselytising",
  "activities of the chaplains (often maintained on the Company\u2019s",
  "expenses which meant at Indian expense) were interpreted",
  "by Indian sepoys, who were generally conservative by nature,",
  "as  interference  in  their  religious  affairs.",
  "To the religious Hindu of the time, crossing the seas",
  "meant loss of caste. In 1856, Lord Canning\u2019s government",
  "passed the General Service Enlistment Act which decreed that",
  "all future recruits to the Bengal Army would have to give",
  "an undertaking to serve anywhere their services might be",
  "required by the government. This caused resentment.",
  "The Indian sepoy was equally unhappy with his emolu-",
  "ments compared to his British counterpart. A more immediate",
  "cause of the sepoys\u2019 dissatisfaction was the order that they",
  "would not be given the foreign service allowance (bhatta)",
  "when serving in Sindh or in Punjab. The annexation of Awadh,",
  "home of many of the sepoys, further inflamed their feelings.",
  "The Indian sepoy was made to feel a subordinate at",
  "every  step  and  was  discriminated  against  racially  and  in",
  "matters of promotion and privileges. The discontent of the",
  "sepoys was not limited to military matters; it reflected the",
  "general disenchantment with and the opposition to British",
  "rule. The sepoy, in fact, was a \u2018peasant in uniform\u2019 whose",
  "consciousness  was  not  divorced  from  that  of  the  rural",
  "population. \u201cThe Army voiced grievances other than its own;",
  "and the movement spread beyond the Army\u201d, observes S.",
  "Gopal.",
  "Finally, there had been a long history of revolts in the",
  "British  Indian  Army\u2014in  Bengal  (1764),  Vellore  (1806),",
  "Barrackpore (1825) and during the Afghan Wars (1838-42)",
  "to mention just a few.",
  "  Beginning  and  Spread  of  the",
  "Revolt",
  " The Spark",
  "The reports about the mixing of bone dust in atta (flour)",
  "and the introduction of the Enfield rifle enhanced the sepoys\u2019172 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "growing  disaffection  with  the  government.  The  greased",
  "wrapping paper of the cartridge of the new rifle had to be",
  "bitten off before loading and the grease was reportedly made",
  "of beef and pig fat. The cow was sacred to the Hindus while",
  "the pig was taboo for the Muslims. The Army administration",
  "did nothing to allay these fears, and the sepoys felt their",
  "religion was in grave danger.",
  "The greased cartridges did not create a new cause of",
  "discontent in the Army, but supplied the occasion for the",
  "simmering  discontent  to  come  out  in  the  open.",
  " Starts at Meerut",
  "The revolt began at Meerut, 58 km from Delhi, on May 10,",
  "1857 and then, gathering force rapidly, soon embraced a vast",
  "area from the Punjab in the north and the Narmada in the",
  "south to Bihar in the east and Rajputana in the west.",
  "Even before the Meerut incident, there were rumblings",
  "of  resentment  in  various  cantonments.  The  19th  Native",
  "Infantry at Berhampore (West Bengal), which refused to use",
  "the newly introduced Enfield rifle and broke out in mutiny",
  "in February 1857 was disbanded in March 1857. A young",
  "sepoy of the 34th Native Infantry, Mangal Pande, went a",
  "step further and fired at the sergeant major of his unit at",
  "Barrackpore. He was overpowered and executed on April 8",
  "while his regiment was disbanded in May. The 7th Awadh",
  "Regiment which defied its officers on May 3 met with a",
  "similar  fate.",
  "And then came the explosion at Meerut. On April 24,",
  "ninety men of the 3rd Native Cavalry refused to accept the",
  "greased  cartridges.  On  May  9,  eighty-five  of  them  were",
  "dismissed, sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and put in",
  "fetters. This sparked off a general mutiny among the Indian",
  "soldiers stationed at Meerut. The very next day, on May 10,",
  "they released their imprisoned comrades, killed their officers",
  "and unfurled the banner of revolt. They set off for Delhi after",
  "sunset.",
  "Choice of Bahadur Shah as",
  "Symbolic Head",
  "In  Delhi,  the  local  infantry  joined  them,  killed  their  own",
  "European officers including Simon Fraser, the political agent,The Revolt of 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 173",
  "and seized the city. Lieutenant Willoughby, the officer-in-",
  "charge of the magazine at Delhi, offered some resistance,",
  "but was overcome. The aged and powerless Bahadur Shah",
  "Zafar was proclaimed the Emperor of India.",
  "Delhi  was  soon  to  become  the  centre  of  the  Great",
  "Revolt  and  Bahadur  Shah,  its  symbol.  This  spontaneous",
  "raising  of  the  last  Mughal  king  to  the  leadership  of  the",
  "country was a recognition of the fact that the long reign of",
  "Mughal dynasty had become the traditional symbol of India\u2019s",
  "political unity. With this single act, the sepoys had transformed",
  "a mutiny of soldiers into a revolutionary war, while all Indian",
  "chiefs who took part in the revolt hastened to proclaim their",
  "loyalty  to  the  Mughal  emperor.  It  also  signified  that  the",
  "rebels  were  politically  motivated.  Though  religion  was  a",
  "factor, the broad outlook of the rebels was not influenced",
  "by religious identity but by the perception of the British as",
  "the  common  enemy.",
  "Bahadur Shah, after initial vacillation, wrote letters to",
  "all the chiefs and rulers of India urging them to organise a",
  "confederacy of Indian states to fight and replace the British",
  "regime. The entire Bengal Army soon rose in revolt which",
  "spread quickly. Awadh, Rohilkhand, the Doab, Bundelkhand,",
  "central India, large parts of Bihar and East Punjab shook off",
  "British  authority.",
  " Civilians Join",
  "The revolt of the sepoys was accompanied by a rebellion of",
  "the civil population, particularly in the north-western provinces",
  "and Awadh. Their accumulated grievances found immediate",
  "expression  and  they  rose  en  masse  to  give  vent  to  their",
  "opposition to British rule. It is the widespread participation",
  "in the revolt by the peasantry, the artisans, shopkeepers, day",
  "labourers, zamindars, religious mendicants, priests and civil",
  "servants which gave it real strength as well as the character",
  "of a popular revolt. Here the peasants and petty zamindars",
  "gave  free  expression  to  their  grievances  by  attacking  the",
  "money-lenders and zamindars who had displaced them from",
  "the land. They took advantage of the revolt to destroy the",
  "money-lenders\u2019 account books and debt records. They also",
  "attacked the British-established law courts, revenue offices",
  "(tehsils),  revenue  records  and  police  stations.174 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "According to one estimate, of the total number of about",
  "1,50,000 men who died fighting the English in Awadh, over",
  "1,00,000  were  civilians.",
  "Within a month of the capture of Delhi by the rebels,",
  "the revolt spread to different parts of the country.",
  " Storm Centres and Leaders of the Revolt",
  "At Delhi the nominal and symbolic leadership belonged to",
  "the Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, but the real command",
  "lay with a court of soldiers headed by General Bakht Khan",
  "who had led the revolt of Bareilly troops and brought them",
  "to Delhi. The court consisted of ten members, six from the",
  "army  and  four  from  the  civilian  departments.  The  court",
  "conducted the affairs of the state in the name of the emperor.",
  "Emperor Bahadur Shah was perhaps the weakest link in the",
  "chain of leadership of the revolt. His weak personality, old",
  "age and lack of leadership qualities created political weakness",
  "at the nerve centre of the revolt and did incalculable  damage",
  "to  it.",
  "At Kanpur, the natural choice was Nana Saheb, the",
  "adopted son of the last peshwa, Baji Rao II. He was refused",
  "the family title and banished from Poona, and was living near",
  "Kanpur.  Nana  Saheb  expelled  the  English  from  Kanpur,",
  "proclaimed himself the peshwa, acknowledged Bahadur Shah",
  "as  the  Emperor  of  India  and  declared  himself  to  be  his",
  "governor.  Sir  Hugh  Wheeler,  commanding  the  station,",
  "surrendered on June 27, 1857 and was killed on the same",
  "day.",
  "Begum Hazrat Mahal took over the reigns at Lucknow",
  "where the rebellion broke out on June 4, 1857 and popular",
  "sympathy  was  overwhelmingly  in  favour  of  the  deposed",
  "nawab. Her son, Birjis Qadir, was proclaimed the nawab and",
  "a regular administration was organised with important offices",
  "shared equally by Muslims and Hindus. Henry Lawrence, the",
  "British resident, the European inhabitants and a few hundred",
  "loyal sepoys took shelter in the residency. The residency was",
  "besieged by the Indian rebels and Sir Henry was killed during",
  "the siege. The command of the besieged garrison devolved",
  "on Brigadier Inglis who held out against heavy odds. The early",
  "attempts of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram toThe Revolt of 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 175",
  "recover  Lucknow  met  with  no  success.  Finally,  Sir  Colin",
  "Campbell,  the  new  commander-in-chief,  evacuated  the",
  "Europeans with the help of Gorkha regiments. In March 1858,",
  "the city was finally recovered by the British, but guerrilla",
  "activity continued till September of the same year.",
  "At Bareilly, Khan Bahadur, a descendant of the former",
  "ruler of Rohilkhand, was placed in command. Not enthusiastic",
  "about the pension being granted by the British, he organised",
  "an army of 40,000 soldiers and offered stiff resistance to",
  "the  British.",
  "In Bihar, the revolt was led by Kunwar Singh, the",
  "zamindar  of  Jagdishpur.  An  old  man  in  his  seventies,  he",
  "nursed a grudge against the British who had deprived him of",
  "his estates. He unhesitatingly joined the sepoys when they",
  "reached Arrah from Dinapore (Danapur).",
  "Maulvi  Ahmadullah  of  Faizabad  was  another",
  "outstanding leader of the revolt. He was a native of Madras",
  "and had moved to Faizabad in the north where he fought a",
  "stiff battle against the British troops. He emerged as one of",
  "the revolt\u2019s acknowledged leaders once it broke out in Awadh",
  "in May 1857.",
  "The most outstanding leader of the revolt was Rani",
  "Laxmibai,  who  assumed  the  leadership  of  the  sepoys  at",
  "Jhansi. Lord Dalhousie, the governor-general, had refused to",
  "allow  her  adopted  son  to  succeed  to  the  throne  after  her",
  "husband Raja Gangadhar Rao died, and had annexed the state",
  "by  the  application  of  the  infamous  \u2018Doctrine  of  Lapse\u2019.",
  "Driven out of Jhansi by British forces, she gave the battle",
  "cry\u2014\u201dmain apni Jhansi nahin doongi\u201d (I shall not  give",
  "away my Jhansi). She was joined by Tantia Tope, a close",
  "associate of Nana Saheb, after the loss of Kanpur. The Rani",
  "of Jhansi and Tantia Tope marched towards Gwalior where",
  "they were hailed by the Indian soldiers. The Sindhia, the local",
  "ruler, however, decided to side with the English and took",
  "View",
  "Here lay the woman who was the only man among the rebels.",
  "\u2014Hugh Rose",
  "(a tribute to the Rani of Jhansi from the man",
  "who defeated her)176 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "shelter at Agra. Nana Saheb was proclaimed the Peshwa and",
  "plans were chalked out for a march into the south. Gwalior",
  "was recaptured by the English in June 1858.",
  "The  sacrifices  made  by  the  common  masses  were",
  "immense and innumerable. The name of Shah Mal, a local",
  "villager in Pargana Baraut (Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh), is most",
  "notable.  He  organised  the  headmen  and  peasants  of  84",
  "villages (referred as chaurasi desh), marching at night from",
  "village to village, urging people to rebel against the British",
  "hegemony.  The  people  attacked  government  buildings,",
  "destroyed the bridges over the rivers and dug up metalled",
  "roads\u2014partially to stop government forces from coming into",
  "the area, and partly because bridges and roads were viewed",
  "as symbols of British rule. Shah Mal sent supplies to the",
  "mutineers in Delhi and prevented all official communication",
  "between  British  headquarters  and  Meerut.  He  made  his",
  "headquarters at the bungalow of an irrigation department on",
  "the banks of the Yamuna and supervised and controlled his",
  "operations from there. In fact, the bungalow was turned into",
  "a \u201chall of justice\u201d, resolving disputes and dispensing judgments.",
  "He also organised an effective network of intelligence for",
  "a short duration, the people of the area felt that the British",
  "rule was over, and their own rule had come. Unfortunately,",
  "in July 1857, Shah Mal was killed by an English officer,",
  "Dunlap. It is alleged that Shah Mal\u2019s body was cut into pieces",
  "and his head displayed on July 21, 1857 to terrify the public.",
  "For more than a year, however, the rebels carried on their",
  "struggle against heavy odds.",
  "  Suppression  of  the  Revolt",
  "The revolt was finally suppressed. The British captured Delhi",
  "on September 20, 1857 after prolonged and bitter fighting.",
  "John Nicholson, the leader of the siege, was badly wounded",
  "and later succumbed to his injuries. Bahadur Shah was taken",
  "prisoner. The royal princes were captured and butchered on",
  "the spot, publicly shot at point blank range by Lieutenant",
  "Hudson himself. The emperor was exiled to Rangoon where",
  "he died in 1862. Thus the great House of Mughals was finally",
  "and completely extinguished. Terrible vengeance was wreakedThe Revolt of 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 177",
  "on the inhabitants of Delhi. With the fall of Delhi the focal",
  "point of the revolt disappeared.",
  "One by one, all the great leaders of the revolt fell.",
  "Military operations for the recapture of Kanpur were closely",
  "associated with the recovery of Lucknow. Sir Colin Campbell",
  "occupied Kanpur on December 6, 1857. Nana Saheb, defeated",
  "at Kanpur, escaped to Nepal in early 1859, never to be heard",
  "of again. His close associate Tantia Tope escaped into the",
  "jungles of central India, but was captured while asleep in April",
  "1859 and put to death. The Rani of Jhansi had died on the",
  "battlefield earlier in June 1858. Jhansi was recaptured by Sir",
  "Hugh  Rose.  By  1859,  Kunwar  Singh,  Bakht  Khan,  Khan",
  "Bahadur Khan of Bareilly, Rao Sahib (brother of Nana Saheb)",
  "and Maulvi Ahmadullah were all dead, while the Begum of",
  "Awadh  was  compelled  to  hide  in  Nepal.  At  Benaras,  a",
  "rebellion had been organised which was mercilessly suppressed",
  "by Colonel Neill, who put to death all suspected rebels and",
  "even  disorderly  sepoys.",
  "By the end of 1859, British authority over India was",
  "fully  re-established.  The  British  government  had  to  pour",
  "immense supplies of men, money and arms into the country,",
  "though the Indians had to later repay the entire cost through",
  "their  own  suppression.",
  "  Why  the  Revolt  Failed",
  " All-India participation was absent",
  "Limited territorial spread was one factor; there was no all-",
  "India  veneer  about  the  revolt.  The  eastern,  southern  and",
  "western parts of India remained more or less unaffected. This",
  "was probably because the earlier uprisings in those regions",
  "had been brutally suppressed by the Company.",
  " All classes did not join",
  "Certain classes and groups did not join and, in fact, worked",
  "against the revolt.",
  "Big zamindars acted as \u201cbreak-waters to storm\u201d; even",
  "Awadh taluqdars backed off once promises of land restitution",
  "were spelt out. Money-lenders and merchants suffered the",
  "wrath of the mutineers badly and anyway saw their class",
  "interests  better  protected  under  British  patronage.178 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Educated Indians viewed this revolt as backward looking,",
  "supportive of the feudal order and as a reaction of traditional",
  "conservative  forces  to  modernity;  these  people  had  high",
  "hopes that the British would usher in an era of modernisation.",
  "Most Indian rulers refused to join, and often gave active",
  "help to the British. Rulers who did not participate included",
  "the Sindhia of Gwalior, the Holkar of Indore, the rulers of",
  "Patiala, Sindh and other Sikh chieftains and the Maharaja of",
  "Kashmir. Indeed, by one estimate, not more than one-fourth",
  "of the total area and not more than one-tenth of the total",
  "population was affected.",
  " Poor Arms and Equipment",
  "The Indian soldiers were poorly equipped materially, fighting",
  "generally with swords and spears and very few guns and",
  "muskets.  On  the  other  hand,  the  European  soldiers  were",

  " Uncoordinated and Poorly Organised",
  "The  revolt  was  poorly  organised  with  no  coordination  or",
  "central leadership. The principal rebel leaders\u2014Nana Saheb,",
  "Tantia Tope, Kunwar Singh, Laxmibai\u2014were no match to",
  "their British opponents in generalship. On the other hand, the",
  "East India Company was fortunate in having the services of",
  "men of exceptional abilities in the Lawrence brothers, John",
  "Nicholson, James Outram, Henry Havelock, etc.",
  " No Unified Ideology",
  "The mutineers lacked a clear understanding of colonial rule;",
  "nor did they have a forward looking programme, a coherent",
  "ideology, a political perspective or a societal alternative. The",
  "rebels represented diverse elements with differing grievances",
  "and  concepts  of  current  politics.",
  "The lack of unity among Indians was perhaps unavoidable",
  "at this stage of Indian history. Modern nationalism was as",
  "yet unknown in India. In fact, the revolt of 1857 played an",
  "important role in bringing the Indian people together and",

  "  Hindu-Muslim  Unity  Factor",
  "During  the  entire  revolt,  there  was  complete  cooperation",
  "between Hindus and Muslims at all levels\u2014people, soldiers,",
  "leaders.  All  rebels  acknowledged  Bahadur  Shah  Zafar,  a",
  "Muslim, as the emperor and the first impulse of the Hindu",
  "sepoys at Meerut was to march to Delhi, the Mughal imperial",
  "capital. According to Maulana Azad, \u201cTwo facts stand out",
  "clearly in the midst of the tangled story of the Rising of",
  "1857. The first is the remarkable sense of unity among the",
  "Hindus and the Muslims of India in this period. The other",
  "is the deep loyalty which the people felt for the Mughal",
  "Crown.\u201d Rebels and sepoys, both Hindu and Muslim, respected",
  "each other\u2019s sentiments. Immediate banning of cow slaughter",
  "was ordered once the revolt was successful in a particular",
  "area.  Both  Hindus  and  Muslims  were  well  represented  in",
  "leadership, for instance Nana Saheb had Azimullah, a Muslim",
  "and  an  expert  in  political  propaganda,  as  an  aide,  while",
  "Laxmibai had the solid support of Afghan soldiers.",
  "Thus, the events of 1857 demonstrated that the people",
  "and  politics  of  India  were  not  basically  communal  or",
  "sectarian  before  1858.",
  "  Nature  of  the  Revolt",
  "Views differ on the nature of the 1857 revolt. It was a mere",
  "\u2018Sepoy  Mutiny\u2019  to  some  British  historians\u2014\u201ca  wholly",
  "unpatriotic and selfish Sepoy Mutiny with no native leadership",
  "and no popular support\u201d, said Sir John Seeley. However, that",
  "is not a complete picture of the event as it involved many",
  "sections of the civilian population and not just the sepoys.",
  "The  discontent  of  the  sepoys  was  just  one  cause  of  the",
  "disturbance.",
  "Dr K. Datta considers the revolt of 1857 to have been",
  "\u201cin the main a military outbreak, which was taken advantage",
  "of  by  certain  discontented  princes  and  landlords,  whose",
  "interests had been affected by the new political order\u201d. The",
  "last mentioned factor gave it an aura of a popular uprising",
  "in certain areas. It was \u201cnever all-Indian in character, but was",
  "localised,  restricted  and  poorly  organised\u201d.  Further,  says",
  "Datta, the movement was marked by absence of cohesion and180 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "unity of purpose among the various sections of the rebels.",
  "It was at the beginning of the twentieth century that",
  "the 1857 revolt came to be interpreted as a \u201cplanned war",
  "of national independence\u201d, by V.D. Savarkar in his book, The",
  "Indian  War  of  Independence,  1857.  Savarkar  called  the",
  "revolt the first war of Indian independence.  He said it was",
  "inspired by the lofty ideal of self rule by Indians through",
  "a  nationalist  upsurge.  Dr  S.N.  Sen  in  his  Eighteen  Fifty-",
  "Seven considers the revolt as having begun as a fight for",
  "religion but ending as a war of independence.",
  "Dr R.C. Majumdar, however, considers it as neither the",
  "first, nor national, nor a war of independence as large parts",
  "of the country remained unaffected and many sections of the",
  "people took no part in the upsurge.",
  "According to some Marxist historians, the 1857 revolt",
  "was \u201cthe struggle of the soldier-peasant democratic combine",
  "against foreign as well as feudal bondage\u201d. However, this view",
  "can be questioned in the light of the fact that the leaders",
  "of the revolt themselves came from a feudal background.",
  "Jawaharlal  Nehru  considered  the  revolt  of  1857  as",
  "essentially  a  feudal  uprising  though  there  were  some",
  "nationalistic elements in it (Discovery of India). M.N. Roy",
  "felt the revolt was a last ditch stand of feudalism against",
  "commercial capitalism. R.P. Dutt also saw the significance",
  "of  the  revolt  of  the  peasantry  against  foreign  domination",
  "even as he acknowledged it to be a defence of the old feudal",
  "order.",
  "The revolt of 1857 is not easy to categorise. While",
  "one can easily dismiss some views such as those of L.E.R.",
  "Rees who considered it to be a war of fanatic religionists",
  "against Christians or T.R. Holmes who saw in it a conflict",
  "between civilisation and barbarism, one cannot quite go so",
  "far as to accept it as a war for independence. It had seeds",
  "of  nationalism  and  anti-imperialism  but  the  concept  of",
  "common nationality and nationhood was not inherent to the",
  "revolt  of  1857.",
  "It  is  doubtful  if  the  separate  communities  that",
  "participated in the revolt did so because they felt a common",
  "nationhood. Furthermore, what of the southern section which",

  "R.C. Majumdar",
  "It has to be admitted that the war against the British was not",
  "inspired by any sentiment of nationalism, for in 1857 India was",
  "not yet politically a nation. It is a fact that the Hindus and",

  "One may say that the revolt of 1857 was the first great",

  "The revolt of 1857 marks a turning point in the history of",
  "India.  It  led  to  far-reaching  changes  in  the  system  of",
  "administration and the policies of the British government.",
  "Even before the Revolt could be suppressed fully, the",
  "British Parliament, on August 2, 1858, passed an Act for the",
  "Better Government of India. The Act declared Queen Victoria",
  "as  the  sovereign  of  British  India  and  provided  for  the",
  "appointment of a Secretary of State for India (a member of",
  "the  British  cabinet).  The  direct  responsibility  for  the",
  "administration of the country was assumed by the British",
  "Crown and Company rule was abolished.",
  "The  assumption  of  the  Government  of  India  by  the",
  "sovereign of Great Britain was announced by Lord Canning",
  "at a durbar at Allahabad in the \u2018Queen\u2019s Proclamation\u2019 issued",
  "on November 1, 1858. (It was by this proclamation that the",

  "Many of the promises made in that proclamation appeared",

  "As per the Queen\u2019s proclamation, the era of annexations",
  "and expansion had ended and the British promised to respect",
  "the dignity and rights of the native princes.",
  "The  Indian  states  were  henceforth  to  recognise  the",
  "paramountcy of the British Crown and were to be treated as",
  "parts of a single charge.",
  "The people of India were promised freedom of religion",
  "without  interference  from  British  officials.",
  "The  proclamation  also  promised  equal  and  impartial",
  "protection under law to all Indians, besides equal opportunities",
  "in government services irrespective of race or creed. It was",
  "also promised that old Indian rights, customs and practices",
  "would be given due regard while framing and administering",
  "the law.",
  "The Army, which was at the forefront of the outbreak,",
  "was thoroughly reorganised and British military policy came",
  "to be dominated by the idea of \u201cdivision and counterpoise\u201d.",
  "The British could no longer depend on Indian loyalty, so the",
  "number of Indian soldiers was drastically reduced even as",
  "the number of European soldiers was increased. The concept",
  "of divide and rule was adopted with separate units being",
  "created  on  the  basis  of  caste/community/region.  Recruits",
  "were to be drawn from the \u2018martial\u2019 races of Punjab, Nepal,",
  "and north-western frontier who had proved loyal to the British",
  "during the Revolt. Effort was made to keep the army away",
  "from civilian population.",
  "The  Army  Amalgamation  Scheme,  1861  moved  the",
  "Company\u2019s European troops to the services of the Crown.",
  "Further, the European troops in India were constantly revamped",
  "by  periodical  visits  to  England,  sometimes  termed  as  the",
  "\u2018linked-battalion\u2019 scheme. All Indian artillery units, except a",
  "few mountain batteries, were made defunct. All higher posts",
  "in the army and the artillery departments were reserved for",
  "the Europeans. Till the first decade of the twentieth century,",
  "no Indian was thought fit to deserve the king\u2019s commission",

  "Thus the era of reforms came to an end.",
  "The conservative reaction in England made the British",

  "aspirations of the educated Indians for sharing power. In the",
  "long term, this new British attitude proved counter-productive",
  "for the Empire, as this caused frustrations in the educated",
  "Indian middle classes and gave rise to modern nationalism",
  "very soon.",
  "The policy of divide and rule started in earnest after",
  "the Revolt of 1857. The British used one class/community",
  "White  Mutiny",
  "In the wake of the transfer of power from the British East India",
  "Company  to  the  British  Crown,  a  section  of  European  forces",
  "employed under the Company resented the move that required the",
  "three Presidency Armies to transfer their allegiance from the defunct",
  "Company to the Queen, as in the British Army. This resentment",
  "resulted in some unrest termed as White Mutiny.",
  "Prior to 1861, there were two separate military forces in India,",
  "operating under the British rule. One was the Queen\u2019s army and",
  "the other comprised the units of the East India Company. The",
  "Company\u2019s troops received batta, extra allowances of pay to cover",
  "various expenditures related to operations in areas other than the",
  "home territories. With transfer of power, the batta was stopped.",
  "Lord Canning\u2019s legalistic interpretation of the laws surrounding the",
  "transfer also infuriated the affected White soldiers.",
  "The White Mutiny was seen as a potential threat to the already",
  "precarious British position in India with a potential of inciting renewed",
  "rebellion among the \u2018still excited population in India\u2019. The demands",
  "of the \u2018European Forces\u2019 included an enlistment bonus or a choice",
  "of release from their obligations. Finally, the demand for free and",
  "clear release with free passage home was accepted, and men opted",
  "to return home. It is also believed that open rebellion and physical",

  "irremediable deterioration. While British territorial conquest",
  "was at an end, a period of systematic economic loot by the",
  "British  began.  The  Indian  economy  was  fully  exploited",
  "without fear.",
  "In accordance with Queen\u2019s Proclamation of 1858, the",
  "Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 was passed, which was to",
  "give  an  impression  that  under  the  Queen  all  were  equal,",
  "irrespective of race or creed. (In reality, the detailed rules",
  "framed for the conduct of the civil service examination had",
  "the effect of keeping the higher services a close preserve",
  "of  the  colonisers.)",
  "Racial hatred and suspicion between the Indians and the",
  "English was probably the worst legacy of the revolt. The",
  "newspapers and journals in Britain picturised the Indians as",
  "subhuman creatures, who could be kept in check only by",
  "superior  force.  The  proponents  of  imperialism  in  India",
  "dubbed the entire Indian population as unworthy of trust and",
  "subjected  them  to  insults  and  contempt.  The  complete",
