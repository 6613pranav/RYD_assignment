  "Beginning of Modern",
  "Nationalism in India",
  "Factors  in  the  Growth  of",
  "Modern  Nationalism",
  "The rise and growth of Indian nationalism has been traditionally",
  "explained  in  terms  of  Indian  response  to  the  stimulus",
  "generated  by  the  British  Raj  through  creation  of  new",
  "institutions,  new  opportunities,  resources,  etc.  In  other",
  "words, Indian nationalism grew partly as a result of colonial",
  "policies and partly as a reaction to colonial policies. In fact,",
  "it  would  be  more  correct  to  see  Indian  nationalism  as  a",
  "product of a mix of various factors:",
  "(i) Worldwide upsurge of the concepts of nationalism",
  "and  right  of  self-determination  initiated  by  the",
  "French  Revolution.",
  "(ii) Indian Renaissance.",

  "(iii) Offshoot of modernisation initiated by the British in",
  "India.",
  "(iv) Strong reaction to British imperialist policies in",
  "India.",
  "Understanding of Contradictions in Indian",
  "and Colonial Interests",
  "People came to realise that colonial rule was the major cause",
  "of India\u2019s economic backwardness and that the interests of",
  "the Indians involved the interests of all sections and classes\u2014",
  "peasants, artisans, handicraftsmen, workers, intellectuals, the",
  "educated and the capitalists. The nationalist movement arose",
  "to take up the challenge of these contradictions inherent in",
  "the  character  and  policies  of  colonial  rule.",
  "Political, Administrative and Economic",
  "Unification of the Country",
  "The British rule in the Indian subcontinent extended from the",
  "Himalayas in the north to the Cape Comorin in the south",
  "and from Assam in the east to Khyber Pass in the west. While",
  "large areas of India had been brought under a single rule in",
  "the past\u2014under the Mauryas or later under the Mughals\u2014",
  "the British created a larger state than that of the Mauryas",
  "or the great Mughals. While Indian provinces were under",
  "\u2018direct\u2019 British rule, the princely states were under \u2018indirect\u2019",
  "British  rule.  The  British  sword  imposed  political  unity  in",
  "India. A professional civil service, a unified judiciary  and",
  "codified civil and criminal laws throughout the length and",
  "breadth of the country imparted a new dimension of political",
  "unity to the hitherto cultural unity that had existed in India",
  "for centuries. The necessities of administrative convenience,",
  "considerations of military defence and the urge for economic",
  "penetration  and  commercial  exploitation  (all  in  British",
  "interests)  were  the  driving    forces  behind  the  planned",
  "development of modern means of transport and communication",
  "such as railways, roads, electricity and telegraph.",
  "From the nationalists\u2019 point of view, this process of",
  "unification  had  a  two-fold  effect:",
  "(i) The economic fate of the people of different regions",
  "got  linked  together;  for  instance,  failure  of  crops  in  one",
  "region affected the prices and supply in another region.Beginning of Modern Nationalism in India \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 241",
  "(ii)  Modern  means  of  transport  and  communication",
  "brought people, especially the leaders, from different regions",
  "together. This was important for the exchange of political",
  "ideas and for mobilisation and organisation of public opinion",
  "on  political  and  economic  issues.",
  "Western Thought and Education",
  "The introduction of a modern system of education afforded",
  "opportunities for assimilation of modern Western ideas. This,",
  "in turn, gave a new direction to Indian political thinking,",
  "although the English system of education had been conceived",
  "by the rulers in the self-interest of efficient administration.",
  "The  liberal  and  radical  thought  of  European  writers  like",
  "Milton, Shelley, John Stuart Mill, Rousseau, Paine, Spencer",
  "and Voltaire helped many Indians imbibe modern rational,",
  "secular,  democratic  and  nationalist  ideas.",
  "The English language helped nationalist leaders from",
  "different linguistic regions to communicate with each other.",
  "Those among the educated who took up liberal professions",
  "(lawyers,  doctors,  etc.)  often  visited  England  for  higher",
  "education. There they saw the working of modern political",
  "institutions in a free country and compared that system with",
  "the Indian situation where even basic rights were denied to",
  "the  citizens.  This  ever-expanding  English  educated  class",
  "formed the middle class intelligentsia who constituted the",
  "nucleus  for  the  newly  arising  political  unrest.  It  was  this",
  "section  which  provided  leadership  to  the  Indian  political",
  "associations.",
  "Role of Press and Literature",
  "The second half of the nineteenth century saw an unprecedented",
  "growth of Indian-owned English and vernacular newspapers,",
  "despite numerous restrictions imposed on the press by the",
  "colonial rulers from time to time. In 1877, there were about",
  "169 newspapers published in vernacular languages and their",
  "circulation  reached  the  neighbourhood    of  1,00,000.",
  "The press while criticising  official policies, on the one",
  "hand, urged the people to unite, on the other. It also helped",
  "spread  modern  ideas  of  self-government,  democracy,  civil",
  "rights  and  industrialisation.  The  newspapers,  journals,",
  "pamphlets and nationalist literature helped in the exchange242 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "of  political  ideas  among  nationalist  leaders  from  different",
  "regions.",
  "Rediscovery of India\u2019s Past",
  "The historical researches by European scholars, such as Max",
  "Mueller, Monier Williams, Roth and Sassoon, and by Indian",
  "scholars such as R.G. Bhandarkar, R.L. Mitra and later Swami",
  "Vivekananda, created an entirely new picture of India\u2019s past.",
  "This picture was characterised by well-developed political,",
  "economic and social institutions, a flourishing trade with the",
  "outside  world,  a  rich  heritage  in  arts  and  culture  and",
  "numerous cities. The theory put forward by European scholars,",
  "that the Indo-Aryans belonged to the same ethnic group from",
  "which  other  nations  of  Europe  had  evolved,  gave  a",
  "psychological boost to the educated Indians. The self-respect",
  "and confidence so gained helped the nationalists to demolish",
  "colonial myths that India had a long history of servility to",
  "foreign  rulers.",
  "Progressive Character of Socio-religious",
  "Reform Movements",
  "These  reform  movements  sought  to  remove  social  evils",
  "which  divided  the  Indian  society;  this  had  the  effect  of",
  "bringing  different  sections  together,  and  proved  to  be  an",
  "important factor in the growth of Indian nationalism.",
  "Rise of Middle Class Intelligentsia",
  "British administrative and economic innovations gave rise to",
  "a new urban middle class in towns. According to Percival",
  "Spear, \u201cThe new middle class was a well-integrated all-India",
  "class with varied background but a common foreground of",
  "knowledge, ideas and values.... It was a minority of Indian",
  "society, but a dynamic minority.... It had a sense of unity",
  "of purpose and of hope.\u201d",
  "This  class,  prominent  because  of  its  education,  new",
  "position and its close ties with the ruling class, came to the",
  "forefront. The leadership to the Indian National Congress in",
  "all its stages of growth was provided by this class.",
  "Impact of Contemporary Movements",
  "in the World",
  "Rise of a number of nations on the ruins of the Spanish and",
  "Portuguese  empires  in  South  America,  and  the  nationalBeginning of Modern Nationalism in India \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 243",
  "liberation movements of Greece and Italy in general and of",
  "Ireland in particular deeply influenced the nationalist ranks.",
  "Reactionary Policies and Racial",
  "Arrogance of Rulers",
  "Racial myths of white superiority were sought to be perpetuated",
  "by the British through a deliberate policy of discrimination",
  "and segregation. Indians felt deeply hurt by this. Lytton\u2019s",
  "reactionary policies such as reduction of maximum age limit",
  "for the I.C.S. examination from 21 years to 19 years (1876),",
  "the grand Delhi Durbar of 1877 when the country was in the",
  "severe grip of famine, the Vernacular Press Act (1878) and",
  "the Arms Act (1878) provoked a storm of opposition in the",
  "country.  Then  came  the  Ilbert  Bill  controversy.  Ripon\u2019s",
  "Government had sought to abolish \u201cjudicial disqualification",
  "based on race distinctions\u201d and to give the Indian members",
  "of the covenanted civil service the same powers and rights",
  "as those enjoyed by their European colleagues. Ripon had",
  "to modify the bill, thus almost defeating the original purpose,",
  "because of the stiff opposition from the European community.",
  "It became clear to the nationalists that justice and fair",
  "play could not be expected where interests of the European",
  "community were involved. However, the organised agitation",
  "by the Europeans to revoke the Ilbert Bill also taught the",
  "nationalists how to agitate for certain rights and demands.",
  "Political  Associations  Before  the",
  "Indian  National  Congress",
  "The  Indian  National  Congress  was  not  the  first  political",
  "organisation  in  India.  However,  most  of  the  political",
  "associations in the early half of the nineteenth century were",
  "dominated by wealthy and aristocratic elements. They were",
  "local or regional in character. Through long petitions to the",
  "British  Parliament  most  of  them  demanded\u2014",
  "  administrative  reforms,",
  "\u25cf",
  " association of Indians with the administration, and",
  "\u25cf",
  " spread of education.",
  "\u25cf",
  "The  political  associations  of  the  second  half  of  the",
  "nineteenth century came to be increasingly dominated by the244 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "educated  middle  class\u2014the  lawyers,  journalists,  doctors,",
  "teachers, etc.,\u2014and they had a wider perspective and a larger",
  "agenda.",
  "Political Associations in Bengal",
  "The Bangabhasha Prakasika Sabha was formed in",
  "1836 by associates of Raja Rammohan Roy.",
  "The Zamindari Association, more popularly known as",
  "the \u2018Landholders\u2019 Society\u2019, was founded to safeguard the",
  "interests of the landlords. Although limited in its objectives,",
  "the Landholders\u2019 Society marked the beginning of an organised",
  "political activity and use of methods of constitutional agitation",
  "for  the  redressal  of  grievances.",
  "The  Bengal  British  India  Society  was  founded  in",
  "1843 with the object of \u201cthe collection and dissemination",
  "of information relating to the actual condition of the people",
  "of British India... and to employ such other means of peaceful",
  "and lawful character as may appear calculated to secure the",
  "welfare, extend the just rights and advance the interests of",
  "all  classes  of  our  fellow  subjects\u201d.",
  "In 1851, both the Landholders\u2019 Society and the Bengal",
  "British  India  Society  merged  into  the  British  Indian",
  "Association.  It  sent  a  petition  to  the  British  Parliament",
  "demanding  inclusion  of  some  of  its  suggestions  in  the",
  "renewed Charter of the Company, such as",
  "(i) establishment of a separate legislature of a popular",
  "character;",
  "(ii) separation  of  executive  from  judicial  functions;",
  "(iii) reduction  in  salaries  of  higher  officers;  and",
  "(iv) abolition of salt duty, abkari and stamp duties.",
  "These were partially accepted when the Charter Act of",
  "1853  provided  for  the  addition  of  six  members  to  the",
  "governor-general\u2019s  council  for  legislative  purposes.",
  "The East India Association was organised by Dadabhai",
  "Naoroji in 1866 in London to discuss the Indian question",
  "and  influence  public  men  in  England  to  promote  Indian",
  "welfare. Later, branches of the association were started in",
  "prominent  Indian  cities.",
  "The Indian League was started in 1875 by Sisir Kumar",
  "Ghosh with the object of \u201cstimulating the sense of nationalism",
  "amongst the people\u201d and of encouraging political education.Beginning of Modern Nationalism in India \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 245",
  "The Indian Association of Calcutta (also known as",
  "the  Indian  National  Association)  superseded  the  Indian",
  "League and was founded in 1876 by younger nationalists of",
  "Bengal  led  by  Surendranath  Banerjea  and  Ananda  Mohan",
  "Bose, who were getting discontented with the conservative",
  "and pro-landlord policies of the British Indian Association.",
  "The  Indian  Association  was  the  most  important  of  pre-",
  "Congress  associations  and  aimed  to  \u201cpromote  by  every",
  "legitimate  means  the  political,  intellectual  and  material",
  "advancement of the people.\u201d It set out to\u2014",
  "(i) create a strong public opinion on political questions,",
  "and",
  "(ii) unify  Indian  people  in  a  common  political",
  "programme.",
  "It protested against the reduction of age limit in 1877",
  "for candidates of the Indian Civil Service examination. The",
  "association demanded simultaneous holding of civil service",
  "examination in England and India and Indianisation of higher",
  "administrative posts. It led a campaign against the repressive",
  "arms act and the vernacular press act.",
  "Branches of the association were opened in other towns",
  "and cities of Bengal and even outside Bengal. The membership",
  "fee was kept low in order to attract the poorer sections to",
  "the  association.",
  "The  association  sponsored  an  all  India  conference",
  "which first took place in Calcutta on December 28 to 30,",
  "1883. More than hundred delegates from different parts of",
  "the country attended. So, in a way the association was a",
  "forerunner of the Indian National Congress as an all-India",
  "nationalist  organisation.  It  later  merged  with  the  Indian",
  "National  Congress  in  1886.",
  "Political Associations in Bombay",
