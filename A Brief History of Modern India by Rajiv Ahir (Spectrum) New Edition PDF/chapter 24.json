  "Scenario",
  "Two  Strands  of  National",
  "Upsurge",
  "Two basic strands of national upsurge can be identified during",
  "the last two years of British rule\u2014",
  "(i)  tortuous  negotiations  involving  the  government,",
  "Congress and Muslim League, increasingly accompanied by",
  "communal  violence  and  culminating  in  freedom  and  the",
  "partition.",
  "(ii) sporadic, localised and often extremely militant and",
  "united mass action by workers, peasants and states\u2019 peoples",
  "which took the form of a countrywide strike wave. This kind",
  "of activity was occasioned by the INA Release Movement,",
  "Royal Indian Navy (RIN) revolt, Tebhaga movement, Worli",
  "revolt, Punjab Kisan Morchas, Travancore peoples\u2019 struggle",
  "(especially the Punnapra-Vayalar episode) and the Telangana",
  "peasant revolt.",
  "Change  in  Government\u2019s",
  "Attitude",
  "When the government lifted the ban on the Congress and",
  "released the Congress leaders in June 1945, they expected",
  "to find a demoralised people. Instead, they found tumultuous",
  "crowds impatient to do something. Popular energy resurfaced",
  "after three years of repression. People\u2019s expectations were",
  "462Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 463",
  "heightened by the release of their leaders. The Wavell Plan",
  "backed by the Conservative government in Britain failed to",
  "break  the  constitutional  deadlock.",
  "In July 1945, Labour Party formed the government in",
  "Britain. Clement Attlee took over as the new prime minister",
  "and Pethick Lawrence as the new secretary of state for India.",
  "In  August  1945,  elections  to  central  and  provincial",
  "assemblies  were  announced.",
  "In September 1945, it was announced that a constituent",
  "assembly would be convened after the elections and that the",
  "government was working according to the spirit of the Cripps",
  "Offer.",
  "The government\u2019s change attitude was dictated by the",
  "following  factors.",
  "1. The end of the War resulted in a change in balance",
  "of global power\u2014the UK was no more a big power while",
  "the USA and USSR emerged as superpowers, both of which",
  "favoured freedom for India.",
  "2. The new Labour government was more sympathetic",
  "to Indian demands.",
  "3. Throughout Europe, there was a wave of socialist-",
  "radical  governments.",
  "4. British soldiers were weary and tired and the British",
  "economy lay shattered. (By 1945 the British government in",
  "London owed India \u00a31.2 billion and was being drained by the",
  "US Lend-Lease agreement, which was finally paid off only",
  "in  2006.)",
  "5. There was an anti-imperialist wave in South-East",
  "Asia\u2014in Vietnam and Indonesia\u2014resisting efforts to replant",
  "French and Dutch rule there.",
  "6. Officials feared another Congress revolt, a revival",
  "of the 1942 situation but much more dangerous because of",
  "a likely combination of attacks on communications, agrarian",
  "revolts, labour trouble, army disaffection joined by government",
  "officials and the police in the presence of INA men with",
  "some  military  experience.",
  "7. Elections were inevitable once the war ended since",
  "the last elections had been held in 1934 for the Centre and",
  "in  1937  for  the  provinces.",
  "The  British  would  have  had  to  retreat;  the  Labour",
  "government only quickened the process somewhat.464 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Congress  Election  Campaign",
  "and  INA  Trials",
  "Elections  were  held  in  the  winter  of  1945-46.",
  " Election Campaign for Nationalistic Aims",
  "The most significant feature of the election campaign was",
  "that it sought to mobilise the Indians against the British; it",
  "did not just appeal to the people for votes.",
  "The  election  campaign  expressed  the  nationalist",
  "sentiments against the state repression of the 1942 Quit India",
  "upsurge. This was done by glorifying martyrs and condemning",
  "officials. The brave resistance of the leaderless people was",
  "lauded; martyrs\u2019 memorials were set up; relief funds were",
  "collected for sufferers; the officials responsible for causing",
  "pain were condemned; and promises of enquiry and threats",
  "of  punishment  to  guilty  officials  were  spelt  out.",
  "The government failed to check such speeches. This had",
  "a  devastating  effect  on  the  morale  of  the  services.  The",
  "prospect of the return of Congress ministries, especially in",
  "those  provinces  where  repression  had  been  most  brutal,",
  "further heightened the fears of those in government services.",
  "A  \u2018gentleman\u2019s  agreement\u2019  with  the  Congress  seemed",
  "necessary  to  the  government.",
  "Mass pressure against the trial of INA POWs, sometimes",
  "described as \u201can edge of a volcano\u201d, brought about a decisive",
  "shift in the government\u2019s policy. The British had initially",
  "decided  to  hold  public  trials  of  several  hundreds  of  INA",
  "prisoners besides dismissing them from service and detaining",
  "without trial around 7,000 of them. They compounded the",
  "folly by holding the first trial at the Red Fort in Delhi in",
  "November 1945 and putting on dock together a Hindu, Prem",
  "Kumar Sehgal, a Muslim, Shah Nawaz Khan, and a Sikh,",
  "Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon.",
  "Another issue was provided by the use of Indian Army",
  "units in a bid to restore French and Dutch colonial rule in",
  "Vietnam  and  Indonesia:  this  enhanced  the  anti-imperialist",
  "feeling among a section of urban population and the Army.Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 465",
  " Congress Support for INA Prisoners",
  " At the first post-War Congress session in September",
  "\u25cf",
  "1945 at Bombay, a strong resolution was adopted declaring",
  "Congress support for the INA cause.",
  " Defence of INA prisoners in the court was organised",
  "\u25cf",
  "by Bhulabhai Desai, Tej Bahadur Sapru, Kailash Nath Katju,",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru and Asaf Ali.",
  " INA Relief and Enquiry Committee distributed small",
  "\u25cf",
  "sums of money and food, and helped arrange employment",
  "for  the  affected.",
  " Fund collection was organised.",
  "\u25cf",
  " The INA Agitation\u2014A Landmark on",
  "Many Counts",
  "The high pitch and intensity at which the campaign for the",
  "release of INA prisoners was conducted was unprecedented.",
  "The  agitation  got  wide  publicity  through  extensive  press",
  "coverage with daily editorials, distribution of pamphlets often",
  "containing  threats  of  revenge,  grafitti  conveying  similar",
  "messages,  holding  of  public  meetings  and  celebrations  of",
  "INA Day (November 12, 1945) and INA week (November",
  "5-11).",
  "The campaign spread over a wide area of the country",
  "and witnessed the participation of diverse social groups and",
  "political  parties.  While  the  nerve  centres  of  the  agitation",
  "were  Delhi,  Bombay,  Calcutta,  Madras,  United  Provinces",
  "towns and Punjab, the campaign spread to distant places such",
  "as Coorg, Baluchistan and Assam. The forms of participation",
  "included  fund  contributions  made  by  many  people\u2014from",
  "film stars, municipal committees, Indians living abroad and",
  "gurudwaras  to  tongawallas;  participation  in  meetings;",
  "shopkeepers closing shops; political groups demanding release",
  "of prisoners;  contributing to INA funds; student meetings",
  "and boycott of classes; organising kisan conferences; and All",
  "India Women\u2019s Conference demanding the release of INA",
  "prisoners.",
  "Those who supported the INA cause in varying degrees,",
  "apart  from  the  Congress,  included  the  Muslim  League,",
  "Communist Party, Unionists, Akalis, Justice Party, Ahrars in",
  "Rawalpindi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha",
  "and the Sikh League.466 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Pro-INA sentiments surfaced in traditional bulwarks of",
  "the  Raj.  Government  employees  collected  funds.  The",
  "loyalists\u2014the  gentlemen  with  titles\u2014appealed  to  the",
  "government  to  abandon  the  trials  for  good  Indo-British",
  "relations.  Men  of  the  armed  forces  were  unexpectedly",
  "sympathetic and attended meetings, received those released",
  "(often in uniforms) and contributed funds.",
  "The central theme became the questioning of Britain\u2019s",
  "right to decide a matter concerning Indians. Britain realised",
  "the political significance of the INA issue, which with each",
  "day assumed more and more of an \u2018Indian versus British\u2019",
  "colour.",
  "Three  Upsurges\u2014Winter  of",
  "1945-46",
  "The nationalist sentiment which reached a crescendo around",
  "the INA trials developed into violent confrontations with the",
  "authority in the winter of 1945-46. There were three major",
  "upsurges\u2014",
  "1. November 21, 1945\u2014in Calcutta over the INA trials.",
  "2. February 11, 1946\u2014in Calcutta against the seven-",
  "year sentence to INA officer Rashid Ali.",
  "3. February 18, 1946\u2014in Bombay, strike by the Royal",
  "Indian Navy ratings.",
  " Three-Stage Pattern",
  "All three upsurges showed a similar three-stage pattern.",
  "Stage I. When a Group Defies Authority",
  "and  is  Repressed",
  "In the first instance of this stage (November 21, 1945), a",
  "student  procession  comprising  some  Forward  Bloc",
  "sympathisers, Student Federation of India (SFI) activists and",
  "Islamia College students, who had joined up with the League",
  "and the Congress, tied flags as a symbol of anti-imperialist",
  "unity, marched to Dalhousie Square\u2014the seat of government",
  "in Calcutta. These protestors refused to disperse and were",
  "lathicharged. They retaliated by throwing stones and brickbats.",
  "The police resorted to firing in which two persons died.Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 467",
  "In the next step (February 11, 1946), the protest was",
  "led by Muslim League students in which some Congress and",
  "communist  students\u2019  organisations  joined.  Some  arrests",
  "provoked the students to defy Section 144. There were more",
  "arrests and the agitating students were lathicharged.",
  "Rebellion by Naval Ratings On February 18, 1946",
  "some 1100 Royal Indian Navy (RIN) ratings of HMIS Talwar",
  "went on a strike to protest against",
  "* racial discrimination (demanding equal pay for Indian",
  "and white soldiers)",
  "* unpalatable food",
  "* abuse  by  superior  officers",
  "* arrest of a rating for scrawling \u2018Quit India\u2019 on HMIS",
  "Talwar",
  "* INA trials",
  "* use of Indian troops in Indonesia, demanding their",
  "withdrawal.",
  "The rebellious ratings hoisted the tricolour, crescent,",
  "and the hammer and sickle flags on the mast of the rebel",
  "fleet. Other ratings soon joined and they went around Bombay",
  "in lorries holding Congress flags threatening Europeans and",
  "policemen. Crowds brought food to the ratings and shop-",
  "keepers invited them to take whatever they needed.",
  "Stage II. When the City People Join In",
  "This  phase  was  marked  by  a  virulent  anti-British  mood",
  "resulting in the virtual paralysis of Calcutta and Bombay.",
  "There were meetings, processions, strikes, hartals, and attacks",
  "on Europeans, police stations, shops, tram depots, railway",
  "stations, banks, besides stopping of rail and road traffic by",
  "squatting on tracks and barricading of streets.",
  "Stage III. When People in Other Parts of the",
  "Country  Express  Sympathy  and  Solidarity",
  "While the students boycotted classes and organised hartals",
  "and processions to express sympathy with other students and",
  "the  ratings,  there  were  sympathetic  strikes  in  military",
  "establishments in Karachi, Madras, Visakhapatnam, Calcutta,",
  "Delhi, Cochin, Jamnagar, Andamans, Bahrain and Aden. There",
  "were strikes by the Royal Indian Air Force in Bombay, Poona,",
  "Calcutta, Jessore and Ambala.468 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Patel and Jinnah persuaded the ratings to surrender on",
  "February 23 with an assurance that national parties would",
  "prevent any victimisation.",
  " Evaluation of Potential and Impact of the",
  "Three Upsurges",
  "The three upsurges were significant in many ways:",
  " Fearless action by the masses was an expression of",
  "\u25cf",
  "militancy in the popular mind.",
  "  Revolt  in  the  armed  forces  had  a  great  liberating",
  "\u25cf",
  "effect  on  the  minds  of  people.",
  " The RIN revolt was seen as an event marking the end",
  "\u25cf",
  "of  British  rule.",
  " These upsurges prompted the British to extend some",
  "\u25cf",
  "concessions:",
  "(i) On December 1, 1946, the government announced",
  "that only those INA members accused of murder or brutal",
  "treatment of fellow prisoners would be brought to trial.",
  "(ii)  Imprisonment  sentences  passed  against  the  first",
  "batch were remitted in January 1947.",
  "(iii) Indian soldiers were withdrawn from Indo-China",
  "and Indonesia by February 1947.",
  "(iv) The decision to send a parliamentary delegation to",
  "India (November 1946) was taken.",
  "(v) The decision to send Cabinet Mission was taken in",
  "January  1946.",
  "But could the communal unity witnessed during these",
  "events, if built upon, have offered a way out of the communal",
  "deadlock? Or, in other words, what was the potential of these",
  "upsurges?",
  "These upsurges were in the nature of direct and violent",
  "conflict with authority, which had obvious limitations. Only",
  "the  more  militant  sections  could  participate.",
  "These upsurges were short-lived and were confined to",
  "a few urban centres while the general INA agitation reached",
  "the  remotest  villages.",
  "Communal  unity  witnessed  was  more  organisational",
  "than a unity among the people. Muslim ratings went to the",
  "League to seek advice and the rest to the Congress and the",
  "Socialists.Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 469",
  "Despite  considerable  erosion  of  the  morale  of  the",
  "bureaucracy, the British infrastructure to repress was intact.",
  "They were soon able to control the situation. It was a Maratha",
  "battalion in Bombay that rounded up the ratings and restored",
  "them to their barracks.",
  " Congress Strategy",
  "The  leftists  claim  that  the  Congress  indifference  to  the",
  "revolutionary situation arose because of two considerations\u2014",
  "that  the  situation  would  go  out  of  its  control  and  that  a",
  "disciplined armed forces were vital in a free India. They also",
  "claim that if the Congress leaders had not surrendered to",
  "power  play,  a  different  path  to  independence  would  have",
  "emerged. But actually these upsurges were an extension of",
  "earlier nationalist activity fostered by the Congress through",
  "its election campaign, its advocacy of the INA cause and",
  "highlighting  of  the  excesses  of  1942.",
  "These upsurges were distinguishable from the earlier",
  "activity  because  of  their  form  of  articulation.  These  were",
  "violent challenges to the authority while the earlier activity",
  "was a peaceful demonstration of national solidarity.",
  "The Congress did not officially support these upsurges",
  "because of their tactics and timing.",
  "Negotiations had been an integral part of the Congress",
  "strategy, to be explored before a mass movement could be",
  "launched,  especially  when  the  British  were  seen  to  be",
  "preparing to leave soon.",
  "In Gandhi\u2019s opinion, the mutiny was badly advised: if",
  "they mutinied for India\u2019s freedom, they were doubly wrong;",
  "if they had any grievances, they should have waited for the",
  "guidance  of  leaders.",
  "Election  Results",
  " Performance of the Congress",
  " It got 91 per cent of non-Muslim votes.",
  "\u25cf",
  "  It  captured  57  out  of  102  seats  in  the  Central",
  "\u25cf",
  "Assembly.",
  " In the provincial elections, it got a majority in most",
  "\u25cf",
  "provinces except in Bengal, Sindh and Punjab. The Congress",
  "majority  provinces  included  the  NWFP  and  Assam  which",
  "were being claimed for Pakistan.470 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  " Muslim League\u2019s Performance",
  " It got 86.6 per cent of the Muslim votes.",
  "\u25cf",
  "  It  captured  the  30  reserved  seats  in  the  Central",
  "\u25cf",
  "Assembly.",
  " In the provincial elections, it got a majority in Bengal",
  "\u25cf",
  "and Sindh.",
  " Unlike in 1937, now the League clearly established",
  "\u25cf",
  "itself as the dominant party among Muslims.",
  "In Punjab A Unionist-Congress-Akali coalition under",
  "Khizr Hayat Khan assumed power.",
  " Significant Features of Elections",
  "The elections witnessed communal voting in contrast to the",
  "strong anti-British unity shown in various upsurges due to",
  "1.  separate  electorates;  and",
  "2. limited franchise\u2014for the provinces, less than 10",
  "per cent of the population could vote and for the Central",
  "Assembly, less than 1 per cent of the population was eligible.",
  "The  Cabinet  Mission",
  "The  Attlee  government  announced  in  February  1946  the",
  "decision  to  send  a  high-powered  mission  of  three  British",
  "cabinet members (Pethick Lawrence, Secretary of State for",
  "India; Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade; and",
  "A.V. Alexander, First Lord of Admiralty) to India to find out",
  "ways and means for a negotiated, peaceful transfer of power",
  "to India. (Pethick Lawrence was the chairman of the mission.)",
  " Why British Withdrawal Seemed",
  "Imminent Now",
  "1. The success of nationalist forces in the struggle for",
  "hegemony  was  fairly  evident  by  the  end  of  the  War.",
  "Nationalism had penetrated into hitherto untouched sections",
  "and areas.",
  "2. There was a demonstration in favour of nationalism",
  "among the bureaucracy and the loyalist sections; because the",
  "paucity of European ICS recruits and a policy of Indianisation",
  "had ended the British domination of the ICS as early as the",
  "First World War and by 1939, there existed a British-Indian",
  "parity. The long war had caused weariness and economicPost-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 471",
  "worries. Now only a depleted, war-weary bureaucracy battered",
  "by the 1942 events remained.",
  "3. The British strategy of conciliation and repression",
  "had  its  limitations  and  contradictions.",
  "  After the Cripps\u2019 Offer there was little left to offer",
  "\u25cf",
  "for  conciliation  except  full  freedom.",
  "  When  non-violent  resistance  was  repressed  with",
  "\u25cf",
  "force, the naked force behind the government stood exposed,",
  "while if the government did not clamp down on \u2018sedition\u2019",
  "or made offers for truce, it was seen to be unable to wield",
  "authority,  and  its  prestige  suffered.",
  " Efforts to woo the Congress dismayed the loyalists.",
  "\u25cf",
  "This policy of an unclear mix presented a dilemma for",
  "the  services,  who  nevertheless  had  to  implement  it.  The",
  "prospect  of  Congress  ministries  coming  to  power  in  the",
  "provinces  further  compounded  this  dilemma.",
  "4. Constitutionalism or Congress Raj had proved to be",
  "a  big  morale-booster  and  helped  in  deeper  penetration  of",
  "patriotic  sentiments  among  the  masses.",
  "5. Demands of leniency for INA prisoners from within",
  "the Army and the revolt of the RIN ratings had raised fears",
  "that the armed forces may not be as reliable if the Congress",
  "started a 1942-type mass movement, this time aided by the",
  "provincial  ministries.",
  "6. The only alternative to an all-out repression of a",
  "mass movement was an entirely official rule which seemed",
  "impossible now because the necessary numbers and efficient",
  "officials were not available.",
  "Views",
  "The British Cabinet saw the growing rift between the Congress",
  "and the Muslim League as their trump card... Both Linlithgow",
  "and the Cabinet looked to the rivalry of the Congress and the",
  "League as their most useful weapon against the demands of",
  "either.",
  "B.R. Tomlinson",
  "Our time in India is limited and our power to control events almost",
  "gone. We have only prestige and previous momentum to trade",
  "on and these will not last long.",
  "Lord Wavell (October 1946)472 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "7.  The  government  realised  that  a  settlement  was",
  "necessary for burying the ghost of a mass movement and for",
  "good  future  Indo-British  relations.",
  "Now the overarching aim of the British policy-makers",
  "was a graceful withdrawal, after a settlement on the modalities",
  "of the transfer of power and nature of post-imperial India-",
  "Britain  relations.",
  " On the Eve of Cabinet Mission Plan",
  "The Congress demanded that power be transferred to one",
  "centre  and  that  minorities\u2019  demands  be  worked  out  in  a",
  "framework  ranging  from  autonomy  to  Muslim-majority",
  "provinces to self-determination or secession from the Indian",
  "Union\u2014but, only after the British left.",
  "The British bid for a united and friendly India and an",
  "active partner in defence of the Commonwealth, because a",
  "divided India would lack in defence and would be a blot on",
  "Britain\u2019s diplomacy.",
  "The British policy in 1946 clearly reflected a preference",
  "for a united India, in sharp contrast to earlier declarations.",
  "On March 15, 1946, the Prime Minister of Britain, Clement",
  "Attlee said: \u201c...though mindful of the rights of minorities...",
  "cannot allow a minority to place their veto on advance of",
  "the majority.\u201d This was a far cry from the Shimla Conference",
  "where Wavell had allowed Jinnah to wreck the conference.",
  " Cabinet Mission Arrives",
  "The Cabinet Mission reached Delhi on March 24, 1946. It",
  "had prolonged discussions with Indian leaders of all parties",
  "and groups on the issues of",
  "(i)interim government; and",
  "(ii)principles  and  procedures  for  framing  a  new",
  "constitution giving freedom to India.",
  "As the Congress and the League could not come to any",
  "agreement on the fundamental issue of the unity or partition",
  "of India, the mission put forward its own plan for the solution",
  "of  the  constitutional  problem  in  May  1946.",

  "The League had only sought a foothold in the government478 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",

  "the Interim Government.",
  "In  February  1947,  nine  Congress  members  of  the",
  "cabinet wrote to the viceroy demanding the resignation of",
  "League members and threatening the withdrawal of their own",
  "nominees. The last straw came with the League demanding",
  "the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. A crisis seemed",
  "to be developing rapidly.",
  "Birth  and  Spread  of",
  "Communalism  in  India",
  "With the rise of nationalism, communalism appeared around",
  "the end of the nineteenth century. It proved to be a huge threat",
  "to the unity of the Indian people and the national movement.",
  "The legacy, unfortunately continues.",
  " Characteristic Features of Indian",
  "Communalism",
  "Communalism (more accurately \u2018sectarianism\u2019) is basically",
  "an  ideology,  which  gives  more  importance  to  one\u2019s  own",
  "ethnic/religious group rather than to the wider society as a",
  "whole, evolved through three broad stages in India.",
  "(i) Communal Nationalism: the notion that since a",
  "group or a section of people belong to a particular religious",
  "community, their secular interests are the same, i.e., even",
  "those matters which have got nothing to do with religion",
  "affect all of them equally.",
  "(ii) Liberal Communalism: the notion that since two",
  "religious communities have different religious interests, they",
  "have different interests in the secular sphere also (i.e., in",
  "economic,  political  and  cultural  spheres).",
  "(iii) Extreme Communalism: the notion that not only",
  "do different religious communities have different interests,",
  "but  also  that  these  interests  are  incompatible,  i.e.,  two",
  "communities  cannot  co-exist  because  the  interests  of  one",
  "community  come  into  conflict  with  those  of  the  other.Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 479",
  "There is nothing unique about Indian communalism. It",
  "was  the  result  of  the  conditions  which  have,  in  other",
  "societies, produced similar phenomena and ideologies such",
  "as  Fascism,  anti-Semitism,  racism,  the  Catholic-Protestant",
  "conflict in Northern Ireland and the Christian-Muslim conflict",
  "in Lebanon.",
  "Bypassing basic economic interests, the communalists",
  "claim  to  protect  interests  which  do  not  necessarily  exist.",
  "Communalism is a modern phenomenon\u2014rooted in the",
  "modern social, economic and political colonial structure\u2014",
  "that  emerged  out  of  modern  politics  based  on  mass",
  "mobilisation and popular participation. Modern politics made",
  "it necessary for people to have wider links and loyalties and",
  "to form establish identities. This process involved the spread",
  "of  modern  ideas  of  nation,  class  and  cultural-linguistic",
  "identity. In India, religious consciousness was transformed",
  "into communal consciousness in some parts of the country",
  "and among some sections of the people.",
  "Its social roots lay in the rising middle classes who",
  "propagated imaginary communal interests to further their own",
  "economic interests\u2014communalism was a bourgeois question",
  "par  excellence,  according  to  the  Left.",
  "Communalists were backed in their communal campaign",
  "by the colonial administration. It was the channel through",
  "which colonialists expanded their social base.",
  "Communalists  and  colonialists  were  helped  in  their",
  "sinister  motives  by  the  fact  that  often  socio-economic",
  "distinctions  in  Indian  society  coincided  with  religious",
  "distinctions. The inherent class contradictions were given a",
  "post-facto  communal  colouring  by  the  vested  interests.",
  "Conservative  social  reactionary  elements  gave  full",
  "support  to  communalism.",
  "Religiosity itself did not amount to communalism but",
  "in a country where lack of education and low awareness of",
  "the outside world was a sad reality, religion had the potential",
  "of becoming, and was used as, a vehicle of communalism.",
  " Reasons for Growth of Communalism",
  "Communalism grew in the modern economic, political and",
  "social institutions where new identities were emerging in a480 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "haphazard manner even as the old, pre-modern identities had",
  "not diminished. A clash of this fundamental dichotomy gave",
  "rise  to  a  communal  ideology.",
  "Socio-economic  Reasons",
  "Religion did not actually dictate the economic and political",
  "interests  of  the  Hindus  and  Muslims.  One  community",
  "(consisting  of  Hindus  as  well  as  Muslims)  differed  from",
  "another (also consisting of Hindus and Muslims) by language,",
  "culture,  caste,  social  status,  food  and  dress  habits,  social",
  "practices or customs and so on. Even socially and culturally",
  "the Hindu and the Muslim masses had developed common",
  "ways of life: a Bengali Muslim has much more in common",
  "with a Bengali Hindu than with a Punjabi Muslim. Moreover,",
  "Hindus and the Muslims were equal victims of oppression",
  "and exploitation by British imperialism.",
  "Modern Western thought and scientific ideas were not",
  "absorbed by Muslim intellectuals, who remained traditional",
  "and  backward.  Even  when,  as  a  result  of  the  efforts  of",
  "reformers,  modern  education  spread  among  Muslims,  the",
  "proportion of the educated was far lower among Muslims",
  "than among Hindus, Parsis or Christians. The Muslims also",
  "lagged  behind  as  participants  in  the  growth  of  trade  and",
  "industry. As the number of educated persons and men of trade",
  "and industry among the Muslims was rather small, it was easy",
  "for the reactionary big landlords and the richer classes to",
  "continue to wield influence over the Muslim masses. Landlords",
  "and  zamindars,  whether  Hindu  or  Muslim,  supported  the",
  "British rule out of self-interest. But, among the Hindus, the",
  "modern intellectuals and the rising commercial and industrialist",
  "class had taken over the leadership from the old order of",
  "landlords.",
  "The  educated  Muslims  found  few  opportunities  in",
  "business  or  the  professions;  they  inevitably  looked  for",
  "government employment. The British officials and the loyalist",
  "Muslim  leaders  incited  the  educated  Muslims  against  the",
  "educated Hindus. Syed Ahmad Khan and others demanded",
  "special treatment for the Muslims in the matter of government",
  "service, on the one hand, and on the other told the Muslims",
  "that if the educated Muslims remained loyal to the British,Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 481",
  "the latter would reward them with government jobs and other",
  "special  favours.  The  same  arguments  were  used  by  some",
  "loyalist Hindus and Parsis with regard to their people, but",
  "they were in a small minority.",
  "As a result of the underdevelopment due to colonial",
  "policies, there was a lack of industrial development; hence,",
  "unemployment was an acute problem in India, especially for",
  "the  educated,  and  there  was  an  intense  competition  for",
  "existing jobs. In the circumstances there were advocates of",
  "short-sighted and short-term solutions such as reservation in",
  "jobs on communal, provincial or caste lines. These persons",
  "aroused communal and religious and, later, caste and provincial",
  "passions in an attempt to get a larger share of the existing,",
  "limited  employment  opportunities.  It  was  easy  for  those",
  "desperately searching for jobs for employment to fall prey",
  "to such ideas.",
  "Because of the economic backwardness of India and",
  "rampant  unemployment,  there  was  ample  scope  for  the",
  "colonial  government  to  use  concessions,  favours  and",
  "reservations  to  fuel  communal  and  separatist  tendencies.",
  "Also, modern political consciousness was late in developing",
  "among  the  Muslims  and  the  dominance  of  traditional",
  "reactionary  elements  over  the  Muslim  masses  helped  a",
  "communal  outlook  to  take  root.",
  "There  was  talk  of  Hindu  nationalism  and  Muslim",
  "nationalism. Politically immature, many Hindus as well as",
  "Views",
  "There has been a difference of a generation or more in the",
  "development of the Hindu and the Muslim middle classes, and",
  "that  difference  continues  to  show  itself  in  many  directions,",
  "political, economic, and other. It is this lag which produces a",
  "psychology of fear among the Muslims.",
  "Jawaharlal Nehru in The Discovery of India",
  "He who does what is beneficial to the people of this country,",
  "be he a Muhammedan or an Englishman, is not alien. \u2018Alienness\u2019",
  "has to do with interests. Alienness is certainly not concerned",
  "with white or black skin or religion.",
  "Bal Gangadhar Tilak482 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Muslims did not realise that the economic, educational and",
  "cultural difficulties they were experiencing were born out of",
  "their  subjection  to  foreign  rule  and  because  of  economic",
  "underdevelopment.",
  "British  Policy  of  Divide  and  Rule",
  "Muslims were generally looked upon with suspicion initially,",
  "especially  after  the  Wahabi  and  1857  revolts,  and  were",
  "subjected  to  repression  and  discrimination  by  the  British",
  "government. Also, the introduction of English education had",
  "undermined Arabic and Persian learning which added further",
  "to the economic backwardness and exclusion of the Muslims",
  "from  service.",
  "After the 1870s, with signs of the emergence of Indian",
  "nationalism and growing politicisation of the educated middle",
  "classes, the government reversed its policy of repression of",
  "Muslims  and,  instead,  decided  to  rally  them  behind  the",
  "government through concessions, favours and reservations,",
  "and  used  them  against  nationalist  forces.  The  government",
  "used  persons  like  Sir  Syed  Ahmed  Khan  to  counter  the",
  "growing influence of the Congress. Syed Ahmed Khan had",
  "a broadminded and reformist outlook initially but later he",
  "started  supporting  the  colonial  government,  exhorting  the",
  "Muslim masses to stay away from the Congress and not to",
  "get politicised. He also started talking of separate interests",
  "of Hindus and Muslims.",
  "Communalism  in  History  Writing",
  "Initially suggested by imperialist historians and later adopted",
  "by  some  chauvinist  Indian  historians,  the  communal",
  "interpretation of Indian history portrayed the ancient phase",
  "as the Hindu phase and the medieval phase (which included",
  "the rule of the Turks, the Afghans and the Mughals) as the",
  "Muslim  phase.  The  conflicts  of  ruling  classes  during  the",
  "medieval phase were distorted and exaggerated as Hindu-",
  "Muslim  conflicts.",
  "Historians  ignored  the  fact  that  politics,  ancient  and",
  "medieval  as  of  all  times  and  anywhere,  was  based  on",
  "economic  and  political  interests  and  not  on  religious",
  "considerations.  It  was  in  the  interests  of  the  British  and",
  "communal historians to refuse to acknowledge the notion ofPost-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 483",

  "M.K. Gandhi",
  "a composite culture in India. On its part, the Hindu communal",
  "view of history chose to project the view that Indian society",
  "and culture had reached ideal heights in the ancient period",
  "from  which  they  began  to  decay  in  the  medieval  period",
  "because  of  \u2018Muslim\u2019  rule.  In  this,  there  was  a  refusal  to",
  "acknowledge how Indian economy and technology, religion",
  "and philosophy, arts and literature, culture and society had",
  "developed and been enriched in the medieval period.",
  "Side-effects  of  Socio-religious  Reform  Movements",
  "Reform movements such as the Wahabi Movement among",
  "Muslims  and  Shuddhi  among  Hindus  with  their  militant",
  "overtones  made  the  role  of  religion  more  vulnerable  to",
  "communalism. Reforms, at times, were seen as a process of",
  "insulating  one  community  from  the  influence  of  another",
  "religious  community.",
  "Side-effects  of  Militant  Nationalism",
  "The  early  nationalists  made  conscious  efforts  to  remove",
  "minority fears. Dadabhai Naoroji, presiding over the second",
  "Congress  session  (1886),  declared  the  intentions  of  the",
  "Congress not to raise socio-religious questions in its forums.",
  "In  1889  the  Congress  decided  not  to  take  up  any  issue",
  "opposed  by  the  Muslims.  But  later,  with  the  coming  of",
  "militant nationalism, a distinct Hindu nationalist tinge was",
  "palpable  in  the  nationalist  politics.  For  instance,  Tilak\u2019s",
  "Ganapati and Shivaji festivals and anti-cow slaughter campaigns",
  "created much suspicion. Aurobindo\u2019s vision of an Aryanised",
  "world, the Swadeshi Movement with elements like dips in",
  "the Ganga and revolutionary activity with oath-taking before",
  "goddesses were hardly likely to enthuse Muslims into these",
  "campaigns  in  a  big  way.  The  communal  element  in  the",
  "Lucknow Pact (1916) and the Khilafat agitation (1920-22)",
  "was  too  visible  to  be  of  insignificant  consequences.484 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "When the Khilafat question came up, there was unease",
  "among some Congressmen who felt that the issue was not",
  "really nationalistic. The fight against imperialistic Britain in",
  "this  case  was  not  about  the  economic  and  political",
  "consequences  of  imperialism,  but  on  the  ground  that  the",
  "Caliph and some holy places of Islam were being threatened.",
  "The Muslims\u2019 sympathy for Turkey was on religious grounds.",
  "Even later, the heroes and myths and cultural traditions the",
  "Muslims appealed to belonged not to the history of India but",
  "to the history of West Asia. Though this tendency did not",
  "immediately clash with Indian nationalism, but in fact made",
  "its supporters anti-imperialist, in the longer term, it encouraged",
  "the habit of looking at political questions from a religious",
  "point of view.",
  "Communal  Reaction  by  Majority  Community",
  "The  minority  communalism  met  with  a  reaction  from  the",
  "majority  community.  From  the  1870s  itself,  some  Hindu",
  "zamindars, moneylenders and middle-class professionals began",
  "to give expression to anti-Muslim sentiments. They went to",
  "the extent of declaring that the British had liberated the land",
  "from Muslim tyranny and saved the Hindus from the oppression",
  "by Muslims. The cause of Hindi was given a communal colour",
  "by saying that Urdu was the language of the Muslims (which",
  "was  not  historically  quite  correct).",
  "Then  came  organisations  to  promote  a  communal",
  "outlook. The Punjab Hindu Sabha, founded in 1909 by U.N.",
  "Mukherjee and Lal Chand, opposed the Congress for trying",
  "to unite Indians of all colours into a single nation. They",
  "argued that Hindus should side with the colonial government",
  "in their fight against Muslims. The All-India Hindu Mahasabha",
  "held  its  first  session  in  April  1915  with  the  Maharaja  of",
  "Kasim Bazar as president. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh",
  "(RSS) was established in 1925. However, Hindu communalism",
  "was not a strong force for a long time as the modern secular",
  "intelligentsia  and  middle  class  among  Hindus  wielded  a",
  "greater influence. This was not the case with the Muslims;",
  "the  Muslim  communal  elements  \u2013  landlords,  traditional",
  "religious  leaders  and  bureaucrats  \u2013  exercised  a  lot  of",
  "influence  on  the  Muslims.Post-War National Scenario  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 485",
  "The one-upmanship of different versions of communal",
  "tendencies was a factor which deterred any effective counter-",
  "offensive  against  communalism.",
  " Evolution of the Two-Nation Theory",
  "The development of the two-nation theory over the years is",
  "as  follows:",
  "1887: There was a frontal attack on the Congress by",
  "Dufferin, the viceroy, and Colvin, the Lt. Governor of the",
  "United Provinces. Syed Ahmed Khan and Raja Shiv Prasad",
  "of Bhinga were propped up as an anti-Congress front by the",
  "government.  Syed  Ahmed  Khan  appealed  to  the  educated",
  "Muslims  to  stay  away  from  the  Congress,  although  some",
  "Muslims did join the Congress. These included Badruddin",
  "Tyabji, Mir Musharraf Hussain, A. Bhimji and Hamid Ali",
  "Khan.",
  "1906: Agha Khan led a Muslim delegation (called the",
  "Shimla delegation) to the viceroy, Lord Minto, to demand",
  "separate electorates for Muslims at all levels and that the",
  "Muslim  representation  should  be  commensurate  not  only",
  "with their numerical strength but also with their \u201cpolitical",
  "importance  and  their  contribution  to  the  British  Empire\u201d.",
  "Minto assured them of special communal representation in",
  "excess of their population for their \u201cextraordinary service\u201d",
  "to  the  empire.",
  "The All India Muslim League was founded by the Agha",
  "Khan, Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk",
  "and Nawab Waqar-ul-Mulk to preach loyalty to the British",
  "government and to keep the Muslim intelligentsia away from",
  "the  Congress.",
  "1909: Separate electorates were awarded under Morley-",
  "Minto  Reforms.",
  "Punjab Hindu Sabha was founded by U.N. Mukherji and",
  "Lal Chand.",
  "1915: First session of All India Hindu Mahasabha was",
  "held under the aegis of the Maharaja of Kasim Bazar.",
  "1912-24: During this period, the Muslim League was",

  "1916:  The  Congress  accepted  the  Muslim  League",
  "demand  of  separate  electorates  and  the  Congress  and  the",
  "League presented joint demands to the government. But the",
  "Congress and the League came together as separate political",
  "entities  and  the  Congress  gave  political  legitimacy  to  the",
  "existence  of  the  Muslim  League.",
  "1920-22:  Muslims  participated  in  the  Rowlatt  and",
  "Khilafat Non-Cooperation agitations but there was a communal",
  "element  in  the  political  outlook  of  the  Muslims.",
  "1920s: The shadow of communal riots loomed large",
  "over  the  country.  The  Arya  Samajists  started  Shuddhi",
  "(purification) and Sangathan (organisation) movements. The",
  "Shuddhi movement was aimed at reconverting to Hinduism",
  "those who had converted to Islam. The Muslims started the",
  "Tabligh and Tanzeem movements in retaliation.",
  "Some nationalists also turned communal. The Swarajists",
  "were  divided  along  communal  lines  and  many  of  the",
  "Responsivists among them joined the Hindu Mahasabha. The",
  "Ali brothers, after having put up a spectacular united front",
  "with the Congress, accused the Congress of protecting only",
  "Hindu  interests.",
  "The Congress failed to evolve a suitable strategy to",
  "counter  the  rise  of  communalism.",
  "1928: The Nehru Report on constitutional reforms as",
  "suggested by the Congress was opposed by Muslim hardliners",
  "and  the  Sikh  League.  Jinnah  proposed  fourteen  points",
  "demanding separate electorates and reservation for Muslims",
  "in  government  service  and  self-governing  bodies.  By",
  "negotiating with the Muslim League, the Congress made a",
  "number  of  mistakes:",
  "1. It gave legitimacy to the politics of the League, thus",
  "giving recognition to the division of society into separate",
  "communities  with  separate  interests.",
  "2. It undermined the role of secular, nationalist Muslims.",
  "3.  Concessions  to  one  community  prompted  other",
  "communities  to  demand  similar  concessions.",
  "4. Launching an all-out attack on communalism became",
  "difficult.",

  "i-ulema-i-Hind, State of Kashmir and Khudai Khidmatgars",
  "participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement but overall",
  "the participation of Muslims was nowhere near the level of",
  "the Khilafat agitation. While the Congress stayed away from",
  "two of the three round table conferences held in London to",
  "discuss  further  constitutional  reforms,  the  communalists",
  "attended all three of them.",
  "1932:  The  Communal  Award  accepted  all  Muslim",
  "communal demands contained in the 14 points.",
  "After 1937: After the Muslim League performed badly",
  "in  the  1937  provincial  elections,  it  decided  to  resort  to",
  "extreme communalism. There began a tendency to project",
  "the Muslims, not as a minority but as a separate nation (in",
  "the early 1930s this idea of a separate Muslim nation was",
  "proposed by a young Muslim intellectual Rahmat Ali and later",
  "developed further by the poet Iqbal). From now onwards,",
  "communalism was organised as a mass movement with its",
  "base among middle and upper classes. Vicious propaganda",
  "was  launched  against  the  Congress  by  Z.A.  Suleri,  F.M.",
  "Durrani, Fazl-ul-Haq, etc. Extreme communalism was based",
  "on fear, hatred and violence of word and deed.",
  "Till 1937 there had been liberal communalism, centred",
  "around safeguards and reservations. It was communal while",
  "upholding  certain  liberal,  democratic,  humanistic  and",
  "nationalistic  values  and  the  notion  that  these  diverse",
  "communities could be welded together into one nation in one",
  "national  interest.",
  "The extreme communalism of Muslims found its echo",
  "in the militant communal nationalism of Hindus represented",
  "by organisations such as the Hindu Mahasabha and RSS and",
  "in the thoughts of leaders like Golwalkar. There were several",
  "reasons  for  the  advent  of  extreme  communalism.",
  "1.  With  increasing  radicalisation,  the  reactionary",
  "elements  searched  for  a  social  base  through  channels  of",
  "communalism.",
  "2. The colonial administration had exhausted all other",
  "means to divide nationalists.",
  "3. Earlier failures to challenge communal tendencies",
