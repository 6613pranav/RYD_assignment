  "Against British",
  "Before 1857",
  "Most of us think of the 1857 Revolt as the first major show",
  "of resentment against the British who were represented by",
  "the rule of the East India Company. However, there were",
  "many incidents before the 1857 revolt that indicated all was",
  "not well and that there was a building resentment against the",
  "alien rule. This resentment manifested itself in several bouts",
  "of  resistance  by  different  groups  of  people  in  different",
  "regions of India.",

  "  People\u2019s  Resistance:  Meaning",
  "In the context of people\u2019s resistance against the British rule,",
  "the word \u2018people\u2019 encompasses several sections of the Indian",
  "society who were affected by the alien rule. The peasants,",
  "artisans,  tribals,  ruling  classes  (active  or  dispossessed),",
  "military personnel (those under the Company as well as the",
  "demobilised soldiers of ex-rulers), religious leaders (Hindu",
  "and Muslim), etc., fought for the protection of their interests,",
  "at times separately and at times together.  The agitation in",
  "Benares in 1810 against a house tax imposed by the colonial",
  "government, the Surat riots in 1814 against the salt duty, the",
  "rising in Bareilly in 1816 against police tax and municipal",
  "taxes,  are  some  examples  of  urban  movements  in  which",
  "people from lower strata like artisans, petty shopkeepers, and",
  "the urban poor fought together with the prosperous urban",
  "gentry.  The  interests  of  these  resistances  differed  in  the",
  "sense that each section had different grievances, but converged",
  "on a common objective\u2014to end the British rule.",
  "According to Bipan Chandra, people\u2019s resistance took",
  "three  broad  forms:  civil  rebellions,  tribal  uprisings  and",
  "peasant  movements.  We  have  also  considered  military",
  "revolts  as  a  form  of  people\u2019s  resistance,  which  involved",
  "Indians employed in the Company\u2019s forces, to make the study",
  "of  people\u2019s  resistance  more  comprehensive.",
  "  Genesis  of  People\u2019s  Resistance",
  "In pre-colonial India, people\u2019s protests against the rulers and",
  "their  officials  were  not  uncommon\u2014high  land  revenue",
  "demand by the State, corrupt practices and hard attitude of",
  "the officials being some of the instigating factors. However,",
  "the establishment of colonial rule and its policies had a much",
  "more annihilative effect on the Indians as a whole. There was",
  "no  one  to  hear  their  grievances  or  pay  attention  to  their",
  "problems. The Company was merely interested in extracting",
  "revenue.",
  "The colonial law and judiciary safeguarded the interest",
  "of the government and its collaborators\u2014the landlords, the",
  "merchants and money-lenders. Thus the people left with no",
  "options, chose to take up arms and defend themselves. The138 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "conditions of the tribal people were not different from those",
  "of the people living in the mainland but the encroachment",
  "by outsiders into their independent tribal polity made them",
  "more aggrieved and violent.",
  " Causative Factors for People\u2019s Uprisings",
  "The  major  factors  responsible  for  the  people\u2019s  resentment",
  "and uprisings against the Company rule are as follows.",
  " Colonial land revenue settlements, heavy burden of",
  "\u25cf",
  "new  taxes,  eviction  of  peasants  from  their  lands,  and",
  "encroachments  on  tribal  lands.",
  " Exploitation in rural society coupled with the growth",
  "\u25cf",
  "of  intermediary  revenue  collectors,  tenants  and  money-",
  "lenders.",
  " Expansion of revenue administration over tribal lands",
  "\u25cf",
  "leading to the loss of tribal people\u2019s hold over agricultural",
  "and forest land.",
  "  Promotion  of  British  manufactured  goods,  heavy",
  "\u25cf",
  "duties on Indian industries, especially export duties, leading",
  "to devastation of Indian handloom and handicraft industries.",
  " Destruction of indigenous industry leading to migration",
  "\u25cf",
  "of  workers  from  industry  to  agriculture,  increasing  the",
  "pressure  on  land/agriculture.",
  "  Civil  Uprisings",
  "The word \u2018civil\u2019 encompasses everything which is not related",
  "to defence/military, but here we have included those uprisings",
  "which were generally led by deposed native rulers or their",
  "descendants,  former  zamindars,  landlords,  poligars  (\u2014in",
  "South India, holders of territory or palayam, consisting of",
  "a few villages granted to them by the rulers\u2014mainly the",
  "Nayakas\u2014in  return  for  military  service  and  tribute),  ex-",
  "retainers  and  officials  of  the  conquered  kingdoms,  or",
  "sometimes by religious leaders. The mass support generally",
  "came  from  rack-rented  peasants,  unemployed  artisans  and",
  "demobilised soldiers, although at the centre of these uprisings",
  "were  erstwhile  power-wielding  classes.",
  " Major Causes of Civil Uprisings",
  " Under the Company rule, there were rapid changes in",
  "\u25cf",
  "the economy, administration and land revenue system that went",
  "against the people.People\u2019s Resistance Against British Before 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 139",
  " Several zamindars and poligars who had lost control",
  "\u25cf",
  "over their land and its revenues due to the colonial rule, had",
  "personal scores to settle with the new rulers.",
  " The ego of traditional zamindars and poligars was hurt",
  "\u25cf",
  "due to being sidelined in rank by government officials and a",
  "new class comprising of merchants and money-lenders.",
  " The ruin of Indian handicraft industries due to colonial",
  "\u25cf",
  "policies impoverished millions of artisans whose misery was",
  "further compounded by the disappearance of their traditional",
  "patrons and buyers\u2014princes, chieftains, and zamindars.",
  " The priestly classes instigated hatred and rebellion",
  "\u25cf",
  "against alien rule, because the religious preachers, priests,",
  "pundits, maulvis, etc., had been dependent on the traditional",
  "landed and bureaucratic elite. The fall of zamindars and feudal",
  "lords directly affected the priestly class.",
  " The foreign character of the British rulers, who always",
  "\u25cf",
  "remained alien to this land, and their contemptuous treatment",
  "of the native people hurt the pride of the latter.",
  " General Characteristics of Civil Uprisings",
  "These uprisings in most cases represented common conditions,",
  "though separated in time and place.",
  "The semi-feudal leaders of civil uprisings were backward",
  "looking and traditional in outlook. Their basic objective was to",
  "restore earlier forms of rule and social relations.",
  "These uprisings were the result of local causes and",
  "grievances and were also localised in their consequences.",
  " Important Civil Uprisings",
  "Sanyasi  Revolt  (1763-1800)",
  "The disastrous famine of 1770 and the harsh economic order",
  "of the British compelled a group of sanyasis in Eastern India",
  "to  fight  the  British  yoke.  Originally  peasants,  even  some",
  "evicted  from  land,  these  sanyasis  were  joined  by  a  large",
  "number of dispossessed small zamindars, disbanded soldiers",
  "and  rural  poor.  They  raided  Company  factories  and  the",
  "treasuries, and fought the Company\u2019s forces. It was only after",
  "a prolonged action that Warren Hastings could subdue the",
  "sanyasis.  Equal  participation  of  Hindus  and  Muslims",
  "characterised  the  uprisings,  sometimes  referred  to  as  the140 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "Fakir Rebellion. Majnum Shah (or Majnu Shah), Chirag Ali,",
  "Musa  Shah,  Bhawani  Pathak  and  Debi  Chaudhurani  were",
  "important leaders. Debi Chaudhurani\u2019s participation recognises",
  "the  women\u2019s  role  in  early  resistances  against  the  British.",
  "Anandamath,  a  semi-historical  novel  by  Bankim  Chandra",
  "Chattopadhyay,  is  based  on  the  Sanyasi  Revolt.  Bankim",
  "Chandra also wrote a novel, Devi Chaudhurani, as he saw",
  "the importance of women too taking up the struggle against",
  "an alien rule that posed a threat to traditional Indian values.",
  "Revolt  in  Midnapore  and  Dhalbhum  (1766-74)",
  "The English took hold of Midnapore in 1760 and at that time",
  "there were about 3,000 zamindars and talukdars having cordial",
  "relations  with  their  ryots.  But  this  harmonious  scenario",
  "changed after the introduction of new land revenue system",
  "by the English in 1772. According to the British governor",
  "Vansittart, the zamindars of Midnapore sided with the ryots",
  "in case of conflict between the ryots and the English revenue",
  "collecting officials. The zamindars of Dhalbhum, Manbhum,",
  "Raipur, Panchet, Jhatibuni, Karnagarh, and Bagri, living in the",
  "vast  tract  of  Jungle  Mahals  of  west  and  north-west",
  "Midnapore\u2014were ultimately dispossessed of their zamindaries",
  "by  1800s.  The  important  leaders  of  the  uprisings  were",
  "Damodar Singh and Jagannath Dhal.",
  "Revolt  of  Moamarias  (1769-99)",
  "The revolt of the Moamarias in 1769 was a potent challenge",
  "to the authority of Ahom kings of Assam.  The Moamarias",
  "were  low-caste  peasants  who  followed  the  teachings  of",
  "Aniruddhadeva (1553-1624), and their rise was similar to that",
  "of  other  low-caste  groups  in  north  India.  Their  revolts",
  "weakened the Ahoms and opened the doors for others to",
  "attack the region, for instance, in 1792, the King of Darrang",
  "(Krishnanarayan), assisted by his band of burkandazes (the",
  "demobilised soldiers of the Muslim armies and zamindars)",
  "revolted.  To  crush  these  revolts,  the  Ahom  ruler  had  to",
  "request for British help. The Moamarias made Bhatiapar their",
  "headquarters. Rangpur (now in Bangladesh) and Jorhat were",
  "the  most  affected  region.  Although,  the  Ahom  kingdom",
  "survived  the  rebellion,  the  weakened  kingdom  fell  to  a",
  "Burmese invasion and finally came under British rule.People\u2019s Resistance Against British Before 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 141",
  "Civil  Uprisings  in  Gorakhpur,  Basti",
  "and  Bahraich  (1781)",
  "Warren Hastings, in order to meet the war expenses against",
  "the Marathas and Mysore, made a plan to earn money by",
  "involving English officers as izaradars (revenue farmers) in",
  "Awadh. He involved Major Alexander Hannay, who was well",
  "acquainted with the region, as an izaradar in 1778. Hannay",
  "secured the izara of Gorakhpur and Bahraich to the amount",
  "of  22  lakh  rupees  for  one  year.  In  fact,  it  was  a  secret",
  "experiment by the Company to see for itself just how much",
  "surplus money was accessible in practice.",
  "However, Hannay\u2019s oppression and excessive demand",
  "of revenue made the region, which had been in a flourishing",
  "state  under  the  Nawab,  panic-striken.  The  zamindars  and",
  "cultivators rose against the unbearable exactions in 1781 and,",
  "within  weeks  of  the  initial  uprising,  all  of  Hannay\u2019s",
  "subordinates  were  either  killed  or  besieged  by  zamindari",
  "guerilla  forces.  Although  the  rebellion  was  suppressed,",
  "Hannay was dismissed and his izara forcibly removed.",
  "Revolt of Raja of Vizianagaram (1794)",
  "In 1758, a treaty was made between the English and Ananda",
  "Gajapatiraju, the ruler of Vizianagaram, to jointly oust the",
  "French from the Northern Circars. In this mission they were",
  "successful but the English, as was usual in their case in India,",
  "went back on their word to honour the terms of the treaty.",
  "Anand Raju died before he could seriously tackle the English.",
  "The East India Company went on to demand a tribute of three",
  "lakh rupees from Vizayaramaraju, the Raja of Vizianagaram",
  "and asked him to disband his troops. This angered the raja",
  "as there were no dues to be paid to the Company. The raja",
  "supported  by  his  subjects  rose  up  in  revolt.  The  English",
  "captured the raja in 1793 and ordered him to go into exile",
  "with a pension. The raja refused. The raja died in a battle",
  "at Padmanabham (in modern Visakhapatnam district in Andhra",
  "Pradesh) in 1794. Vizianagaram came under the Company\u2019s",
  "rule. Later, the Company offered the estate to the deceased",
  "raja\u2019s son and reduced the demand for presents.",
  "Revolt  of  Dhundia  in  Bednur  (1799-1800)",
  "After the conquest of Mysore in 1799, the English had to",
  "confront many native leaders. Dhundia Wagh, a local Maratha142 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "leader, who was converted to Islam by Tipu Sultan and put",
  "into jail due to his mis-adventures, got released with the fall",
  "of Seringapatam. Very soon, Dhundia organised a force which",
  "consisted of anti-British elements, and carved out a small",
  "territory for himself. A defeat by the English in August 1799",
  "forced him to take refuge in Maratha region from where he",
  "instigated the disappointed princes to fight against the English",
  "and he himself took on the leadership. In September 1800,",
  "he was killed while fighting against the British forces under",
  "Wellesley. Though Dhundia failed, he became a venerated",
  "leader  of  the  masses.",
  "Resistance of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja",
  "(1797;  1800-05)",
  "Kerala  Varma  Pazhassi  Raja,  popularly  known  as  Kerala",
  "Simham (Lion of Kerala) or \u2018Pyche raja\u2019, was the de facto",
  "head of Kottayam (Cotiote) in Malabar region. Apart from",
  "resisting Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, Kerala Varma fought",
  "against the British between 1793 and 1805.",
  "The  Third  Anglo-Mysore  War  (1790-92),  extended",
  "English paramountcy over Kottayam in violation of an earlier",
  "agreement of 1790 which had recognised the independence",
  "of Kottayam. The English appointed Vira Varma, the uncle",
  "of Pazhassi Raja, as the Raja of Kottayam. The new raja, to",
  "meet  the  revenue  target  fixed  by  the  Company,  levied",
  "exorbitant rates of tax on the peasants. This led to a mass",
  "resistance by the peasants under the leadership of Pazhassi",
  "Raja in 1793. Pazhassi Raja fought bravely using guerilla",
  "warfare, and in 1797 a peace treaty was made. But a conflict",
  "over  a  dispute  on  Wayanad  in  1800  started  an  insurgent",
  "warfare. Pazhassi Raja organised a large force of Nairs which",
  "was supplemented by Mappilas and Pathans, the latter being",
  "demobilised soldiers of Tipu who had become unemployed",
  "after Tipu\u2019s death. In November 1805, the Kerala Simham",
  "died in a gun-fight at Mavila Todu near present day Kerala-",
  "Karnataka border.",
  "Civil  Rebellion  in  Awadh  (1799)",
  "Wazir Ali Khan, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, with the help",
  "of the British, had ascended the throne in September 1797.",
  "But very soon his relations with the British became sour andPeople\u2019s Resistance Against British Before 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 143",
  "he got replaced by his uncle, Saadat Ali Khan II. Wazir Ali",
  "Khan was granted a pension in Benares. However, in January",
  "1799, he killed a British resident, Geogre Frederik Cherry,",
  "who had invited him to lunch. Wazir Ali\u2019s guards killed two",
  "other Europeans and even attacked the Magistrate of Benares.",
  "The  whole  incident  became  famous  as  the  Massacre  of",
  "Benares. Wazir Ali was able to assemble an army of several",
  "thousand men which was defeated by General Erskine. Wazir",
  "Ali fled to Butwal and was granted asylum by the ruler of",
  "Jaipur.  Arthur  Wellesley  requested  the  Raja  of  Jaipur  to",
  "extradite Wazir Ali. Wazir Ali was extradited on the condition",
  "that he would neither be hanged nor be put in fetters. After",
  "surrender in December 1799, he was placed in confinement",
  "at Fort William, Calcutta.",
  "Uprisings  in  Ganjam  and  Gumsur  (1800,  1835-37)",
  "In the Northern Circars, Ganjam and its adjoining regions",
  "rose  in  revolt  against  the  British  rule.  Strikara  Bhanj,  a",
  "zamindar  of  Gumsur  in  Ganjam  district,  refused  to  pay",
  "revenues in 1797. In 1800, he openly rebelled and defied",
  "the public authorities. Snodgrass, an oppressive and corrupt",
  "collector, was replaced to suppress the insurrection. Strikara",
  "was joined by Jlani Deo of Vizianagar (Poddakimedi) and",
  "Jagannath Deo of Pratapgiri (Chinakimedi). In 1804 Jagannath",
  "Deo was captured and sent to Masulipatnam. But the English",
  "had to assign certain districts to Strikara Bhanj. In 1807-08,",
  "Dhananjaya Bhanj, son of Strikara, forced his father to leave",
  "the estate. Dhananjaya rebelled against the English but was",
  "forced  to  surrender  in  June  1815.",
  "Strikara, who had returned to Ganjam, was reappointed",
  "as the zamindar in a compromise with the government. He",
  "managed the estate between 1819 and 1830 but, failing to",
  "liquidate the arrears, retired in favour of his son, Dhananjay.",
  "However,  unable  to  pay  the  enormous  arrears,  Dhananjay",
  "Bhanj rose in rebellion for the second time when the British",
  "forces occupied Gumsur and Kolaida in November 1835. The",
  "revolt  greatly  reduced  the  government\u2019s  authority  but",
  "Dhananjay died in December 1835 and his followers continued",
  "the resistance. The government appointed Russell, with full",
  "discretionary powers, to deal with the situation. The struggle144 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "lasted till February 1837, when Doora Bisayi, a formidable",
  "leader, was arrested. The zamindari of Gumsur was forfeited.",
  "Uprisings  in  Palamau  (1800-02)",
  "The political situation of Palamau was complicated by the",
  "crises of agrarian landlordism and feudal system. In 1800,",
  "Bhukhan  Singh,  a  Chero  chief,  rose  in  rebellion.  Colonel",
  "Jones  camped  for  two  years  in  Palamau  and  Sarguja  to",
  "suppress  the  rebellion.  Bhukhan  Singh  died  in  1802  and",
  "subsequently the insurrection calmed down.",
  "Poligars\u2019  Revolt  (1795-1805)",
  "The poligars (or palayakkarargal) of South India gave a stiff",
  "resistance to the British between 1795 and 1805. The main",
  "centres  of  these  strong  uprisings  were  Tinneveli  (or",
  "Thirunelveli), Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Sivagiri, Madurai,",
  "and North Arcot. The problem started in 1781, when the",
  "Nawab of Arcot gave the management and control of Tinneveli",
  "and the Carnatic Provinces to the East India Company. This",
  "arrangement caused resentment among the poligars who had,",
  "for  long  considered  themselves  as  independent  sovereign",
  "authorities within their respective territories. The first revolt",
  "of  the  poligars  against  the  Company  was  basically  over",
  "taxation,  but  had  a  larger  political  dimension  in  that  the",
  "English  considered  and  treated  the  poligars  as  enemies.",
  "Kattabomman Nayakan, the poligar of Panjalankurichi, led",
  "the insurrection between 1795 and 1799. After a fierce battle",
  "in which the Company forces were defeated by Veerapandiya",
  "Kattabomman, a price was put on the latter\u2019s head. This led",
  "to greater rebellion by the poligars. With reinforcements the",
  "Company forces were finally able to defeat Kattabomman.",
  "Kattabomman fled into the Pudukottai forests. Once again",
  "a betrayal\u2014this time by Ettappan, the Raja of Pudukottai, who",
  "entered into an agreement with the British\u2014led to the capture",
  "of Kattabomman. Kattabomman was hanged in a conspicuous",
  "place. A close associate, Subramania Pillai was also hanged",
  "and  Soundara  Pandian,  another  rebel,  brutally  killed.  The",
  "palayam  of  Panjalankurichi  and  the  estates  of  five  other",
  "poligars who had joined the rebellion were confiscated and",
  "the  prominent  poligars  executed  or  sent  to  prison.",
  "The second phase, which was more violent than thePeople\u2019s Resistance Against British Before 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 145",
  "previous one, started in February 1801 when the poligars",
  "imprisoned in the fort of Palamcotta were able to escape.",
  "The  rebels  took  control  of  many  forts  and  even  captured",
  "Tuticorin.  The  British  forces  were  soon  reinforced  from",
  "Malabar.  The  fugitives  led  by  Oomathurai,  brother  of",
  "Kattabomman, who fled to Sivaganga in Ramnad joined the",
  "rebellion of the \u2018Marudus\u2019 led by Marathu Pandian which was",
  "suppressed in October 1801. The fort of Panjalankurichi was",
  "razed to the ground and the name of the place was expunged",
  "from all the documents of the district. Meanwhile, the nawab",
  "surrendered the civil and military administration of all the",
  "territories and dependencies of the Carnatic exclusively to",
  "the Company in perpetuity.",
  "Between 1803 and 1805, the poligars of North Arcot",
  "rose in rebellion, when they were deprived of their right to",
  "collect  the  kaval  fees.  (Kaval  or  \u2018watch\u2019  was  an  ancient",
  "institution of Tamil Nadu. It was a hereditary village police",
  "office with specified rights and responsibilities.) The region",
  "was in a lawless condition particularly in the palayams of",
  "Chittur and Chandragiri. The poligar of Yedaragunta, who",
  "proved most daring and desperate among the insurgent chiefs,",
  "was joined by the dispossessed poligar of Charagallu. By",
  "February 1805, the rebels were suppressed. Several chiefs",
  "were ordered to reside in Madras while some others were",
  "granted an allowance of 18 per cent upon revenues of their",
  "estates.",
  "The poligar rebellion spread over a vast area of South",
  "India. The proclamations by the rebels, says A. Shunmugaiah,",
  "indicate that they believed in a mass movement against the",
  "alien rule, seeking independence of them.",
  "Uprising  in  Bhiwani  (1809)",
  "In 1809, the Jats of Haryana broke into rebellion. The Jats",
  "fortified themselves in Bhiwani and made a strong resistance.",
  "A brigade of all arms, with a powerful battering ram, was",
  "required  to  suppress  the  revolt.",
  "Diwan  Velu  Thampi\u2019s  Revolt  (1808-1809)",
  "The East India Company\u2019s harsh conditions imposed on the",
  "state of Travancore, after both of them agreed to a subsidiary",
  "alliance arrangement under Wellesley in 1805, caused deep146 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "resentment in the region. The ruler was not able to pay the",
  "subsidy and fell in arrears. The British resident of Travancore",
  "was meddling in the internal affairs of the state. The high-",
  "handed attitude of the Company compelled Prime Minister",
  "(or  Dalawa)  Velu  Thampi  to  rise  against  the  Company,",
  "assisted  by  the  Nair  troops.  Velu  Thampi  addressed  a",
  "gathering  in  Kundara,  openly  calling  for  taking  up  arms",
  "against the British to oust them from the native soil. This",
  "was later known as the Kundara Proclamation. There was",
  "large scale rebellion against the British as a result. A large",
  "military operation had to be undertaken to restore peace. The",
  "Maharaja of Travancore had not wholly supported the rebellion",
  "and defected to the side of the Company. Velu Thampi killed",
  "himself to avoid capture. The rebellion petered out.",
  "Disturbances  in  Bundelkhand  (1808-12)",
  "The vast province of Bundelkhand, conquered by the British",
  "during the Second Anglo-Maratha Wars (1803-05), was put",
  "within the Presidency of Bengal. The Bundela chiefs offered",
  "resistance to the new government as long as they could fight",
  "from their forts numbering nearly one hundred and fifty. The",
  "first  major  resistance  came  from  Lakshaman  Dawa,  the",
  "killadar (fort commander) of Ajaygarh fort. Lakshman was",
  "permitted to retain the fort as a temporary arrangement for",
  "two years ending in 1808, but he wanted to continue his hold",

  "Sikhs, discouraging the consumption of meat and alcohol and",
  "drugs, permission for intermarriages, widow remarriage, and",
  "encouraging women to step out of seclusion. On the political",
  "side, the Kukas wanted to remove the British and restore Sikh",
  "rule over Punjab; they advocated wearing hand-woven clothes",
  "and boycott of English laws and education and products. So,",
  "the concepts of Swadeshi and non-cooperation were propagated",

  "Peasant participation was active only in some areas affected",
  "by the 1857 rebellion, mainly those in western Uttar Pradesh.",

  "in many places to fight against foreign rule. After the revolt,",

  "Different Causes for Mainland and",

  "The tribal movements can be analysed better if categorised",

  "The mainland tribal rebellions were sparked off by a",

  "ownership  tradition  among  the  tribals  and  disrupted  their",
  "social  fabric.",
  "As agriculture was extended in a settled form by the",
  "Company government, the tribals lost their land, and there",
  "was an influx of non-tribals to these areas.",
  "Shifting cultivation in forests was curbed and this added",
  "to the tribals\u2019 problems. The government further extended its",
  "control over the forest areas by setting up reserved forests",
  "and restricting timber use and grazing. This was the result",
  "of the increasing demand from the Company for timber\u2014",
  "for shipping and the railways.",
  "Exploitation by the police, traders and money-lenders",
  "(most of them \u2018outsiders\u2019) aggravated the tribals\u2019 sufferings.",
  "Some general laws were also abhorred for their intrusive",
  "nature as the tribals had their own customs and traditions.",
  "With  the  expansion  of  colonialism,  Christian",
  "missionaries came to these regions and their efforts interfered",
  "with the traditional customs of the tribals. The missionaries,",
  "perceived as representatives of the alien rule, were resented",
  "by the tribals.",
  "The  movements  of  the  tribes  of  the  north-eastern",
  "frontier  were  different  from  the  non-frontier  tribal  revolts",
  "in  some  aspects.",
  "For one thing, the tribes which shared tribal and cultural",
  "links  with  countries  across  the  border  did  not  concern",
  "themselves much with the nationalist struggle. Their revolts",
  "were often in favour of political autonomy within the Indian",
  "Union  or  complete  independence.",
  "Secondly, these movements were not forest-based or",
  "agrarian revolts as these tribals were generally in control of",
  "land and forest area. The British entered the north-eastern",
  "areas much later than the non-frontier tribal areas.",
  "Thirdly,  the  frontier  tribal  revolts  under  the  British",
  "continued  for  a  longer  time  than  the  non-frontier  tribal",
  "movements. De-sanskritisation movements also spread among",
  "the frontier tribals. The Meiteis organised a movement during",

  "towards  the  money-lenders  and  traders  who  were  seen  as",
  "extensions  of  the  colonial  government.",
  "  A  common  cause  was  the  resentment  against  the",

  "imposition of laws by the \u2018foreign government\u2019 that was seen",
  "as  an  effort  at  destroying  the  tribals\u2019  traditional  socio-",

  "promise that they could end their suffering brought about by",
  "the  \u2018outsiders\u2019.",

  "  Sepoy  Mutinies",
  "A number of sporadic military uprisings took place before",
  "the Great Revolt of 1857 in different parts of the country.",
  " Causes",
  "There was rising discontent of the sepoys against the British",
  "rule  due  to  the  following  reasons:",
  "(i) discrimination in payment and promotions;",
  "(ii) mistreatment of the sepoys by the British officials;",
  "(iii) refusal of the government to pay foreign service",
  "allowance while fighting in remote regions;",
  "(iv) religious  objections  of  the  high  caste  Hindu",
  "sepoys  to  Lord  Canning\u2019s  General  Service",
  "Enlistment Act (1856) ordering all recruits to be",
  "ready for service both within and outside India.",
  "Further,  the  sepoys  shared  all  the  discontent  and",
  "grievances\u2014social,  religious  and  economic\u2014that  afflicted",
  "the civilian population.",
  "Over the years, the upper caste sepoys had found their",
  "religious beliefs in conflict with their service conditions. For",
  "example, in 1806, the replacement of the turban by a leather",
  "cockade caused a mutiny at Vellore. Similarly in 1844, there",
  "was a mutinous outbreak of the Bengal army sepoys for being",
  "sent to far away Sind and in 1824 the sepoys at Barrackpore",
  "rose in revolt when they were asked to go to Burma because",
  "crossing the sea would mean loss of caste.",
  " Important Mutinies",
  "The most important mutinies which broke out during the pre-",
  "1857  period  are  the  following:",
  "(i) The mutiny of the sepoys in Bengal in 1764.",
  "(ii) The Vellore mutiny of 1806 when the sepoys protested",
  "against  interference  in  their  social  and  religious",
  "practices and raised a banner of revolt unfurling the",
  "flag  of  the  ruler  of  Mysore.People\u2019s Resistance Against British Before 1857 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 163",
  "(iii) The mutiny of the sepoys of the 47th Native Infantry",
  "Unit  in  1824.",
  "(iv) The revolt of the Grenadier Company in Assam in",
  "1825.",
  "(v) The mutiny of an Indian regiment at Sholapur in 1838.",
  "(vi) The mutinies of the 34th Native Infantry (N.I.), the",
  "22nd N.I., the 66th N.I. and the 37th N.I. in 1844,",
  "1849,  1850  and  1852  respectively.",
  "However, all these mutinies did not spread beyond their",
  "locality and were ruthlessly crushed by the British Indian",
  "government,  often  inflicting  terrible  violence,  executing",
  "leaders and disbanding the regiments. But the legacy of these",
  "revolts  proved  to  be  of  immense  significance  later.",

  " These uprisings drew  a large number of participants",
  "\u25cf",
  "but were, in fact, localised and occurred at different times",
  "in  different  regions.",
  " They mostly arose out of local grievances.",
  "\u25cf",
  " The leadership was semi-feudal in character, backward-",
  "\u25cf",
  "looking, traditional in outlook and their resistance did not",
  "offer  alternatives  to  the  existing  social  set-up.",
  "  If  many  of  these  revolts  seemed  similar  to  one",
  "\u25cf",
  "another in wanting to oust the alien rule, it was not because",
  "of some \u2018national\u2019 impulse or common effort, but because",
  "they were protesting against conditions that were common",
  "to  them.",
