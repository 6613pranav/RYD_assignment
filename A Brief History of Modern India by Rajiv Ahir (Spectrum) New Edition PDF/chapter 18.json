  "Simon Commission and",
  "the Nehru Report",
  "Appointment  of  the  Indian",
  "Statutory  Commission",
  "The Government of India Act, 1919 had a provision that a",
  "commission would be appointed ten years from date to study",
  "the  progress  of  the  governance  scheme  and  suggest  new",
  "steps.  An  all-white,  seven-member  Indian  Statutory",
  "Commission,  popularly  known  as  the  Simon  Commission",
  "(after the name of its chairman, Sir John Simon), was set",
  "up by the British government under Stanley Baldwin\u2019s prime",
  "ministership on November 8, 1927. The commission was to",
  "recommend  to  the  British  government  whether  India  was",
  "ready for further constitutional reforms and along what lines.",
  "Although constitutional reforms were due only in 1929,",
  "the Conservative government, then in power in Britain, feared",
  "defeat by the Labour Party and thus did not want to leave",
  "the question of the future of Britain\u2019s most priced colony",
  "in \u201cirresponsible Labour hands\u201d. Also by the mid-1920s, the",
  "failure of the 1919 Act to create a stable imperial power",
  "had led to several parliamentary reports and inquiries. The",
  "Lee Commission went into the Raj\u2019s failure to recruit enough",
  "British officers; the Mudiman Commission looked into the",
  "deadlock within the diarchic dispensation; and the Linlithgow",
  "Commission inquired into the crisis of Indian agriculture. So",
  "357358 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "the British government thought it necessary to go more fully",
  "into the working of the 1919 Act. The Conservative Secretary",
  "of State for India, Lord Birkenhead, who had constantly talked",
  "of the inability of Indians to formulate a concrete scheme",
  "of  constitutional  reforms  which  had  the  support  of  wide",
  "sections of Indian political opinion, was responsible for the",
  "appointment  of  the  Simon  Commission.",
  " Indian Response",
  "The Indian response to the Simon Commission was immediate",
  "and nearly unanimous. What angered the Indians most was",
  "the exclusion of Indians from the commission and the basic",
  "notion behind the exclusion that foreigners would discuss and",
  "decide upon India\u2019s fitness for self-government. This notion",
  "was seen as a violation of the principle of self-determination,",
  "and as a deliberate insult to the self-respect of Indians.",
  "Congress  Response",
  "The Congress session in Madras (December 1927) meeting",
  "under the presidency of M.A. Ansari decided to boycott the",
  "commission \u201cat every stage and in every form\u201d. Meanwhile",
  "Nehru succeeded in getting a snap resolution passed at the",
  "session, declaring complete independence as the goal of the",
  "Congress.",
  "Other  Groups",
  "Those who decided to support the Congress call of boycott",
  "of the Simon Commission included the liberals of the Hindu",
  "Mahasabha and the majority faction of the Muslim League",
  "under Jinnah. The Muslim league had two sessions in 1927",
  "\u2013 one under Jinnah at Calcutta where it was decided to oppose",
  "the  Simon  Commission,  and  another  at  Lahore  under",
  "Muhammad  Shafi,  who  supported  the  government.  Some",
  "others, such as the Unionists in Punjab and the Justice Party",
  "in  the  south,  decided  not  to  boycott  the  commission.",
  "Public  Response",
  "The commission landed in Bombay on February 3, 1928. On",
  "that day, a countrywide hartal was organised and mass rallies",
  "held. Wherever the commission went, there were black flag",
  "demonstrations, hartals and slogans of \u2018Simon Go Back\u2019.",
  "A significant feature of this upsurge was that a new",
  "generation of youth got their first taste of political action.Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 359",
  "Dr  Ambedkar  and  the  Simon  Commission",
  "Dr Ambedkar was appointed by the Bombay Legislative Council to",
  "work with the Simon Commission. In October 1928, Ambedkar went",
  "before the commission.",
  "He argued for \u2018universal adult franchise\u2019 for both male and",
  "female alike; for provincial autonomy in the provinces and dyrarchy",
  "at Centre. (Significantly, universal adult franchise was at the time",
  "yet to be guaranteed in most of European countries.)",
  "On behalf of the Bahishkrita Hitakarini Sabha, he submitted",
  "a memorandum on the rights and safeguards he felt were required",
  "for the depressed classes.",
  "Ambedkar said that there was no link between the depressed",
  "classes and the Hindu community, and stated that the depressed",
  "classes should be regarded as a distinct and independent minority.",
  "He asserted that the depressed classes as a minority needed",
  "far greater political protection than any other minority in British India",
  "because of its educational backwardness, its economically poor",
  "condition, its social enslavement, and for the reason that it suffered",
  "from  certain  grave  political  disabilities,  from  which  no  other",
  "community suffered.",
  "In the circumstances, Dr Ambedkar demanded, for the political",
  "protection of the depressed classes, representation on the same",
  "basis as the Mohammedan minority. He wanted reserved seats for",
  "the depressed classes if universal adult franchise was granted. In",
  "case universal franchise was not granted, Ambedkar said he would",
  "campaign for a separate electorate for the depressed classes.",
  "He also expressed the need to have certain safeguards either",
  "in the constitution, if it was possible, or else \u201cin the way of advice",
  "in the instrument to the governor regarding the education of the",
  "depressed classes and their entry into the public services\u201d.",
  "[The report of the Simon Commission did grant reserved seats",
  "to the depressed classes, but the condition was that candidates",
  "who would take part in the elections would have, first of all, to",
  "get their competence endorsed by the governor of the province.",
  "Ambedkar was most displeased with this but, in any case, this",
  "report remained a dead letter.]",
  "They played the most active part in the protest, giving it a",
  "militant flavour. The youth leagues and conferences got a real",
  "fillip.",
  "Nehru and Subhash Bose emerged as leaders of this",
  "new wave of youth and students. Both travelled extensively,",
  "addressed  and  presided  over  conferences.360 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "This upsurge among the youth also provided a fertile",
  "ground for the germination and spread of new radical ideas",
  "of socialism reflected in the emergence of groups such as",
  "the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Workers\u2019 and Peasants\u2019",
  "Parties and Hindustani Sewa Dal (Karnataka).",
  " Police Repression",
  "The police came down heavily on demonstrators; there were",
  "lathicharges not sparing even the senior leaders. Jawaharlal",
  "Nehru and G.B. Pant were beaten up in Lucknow. Lala Lajpat",
  "Rai  received  severe  blows  on  his  chest  in  October  1928",
  "which proved fatal and he died on November 17, 1928.",
  "View",
  "The blows, which fell on me today, are the last nails driven",
  "into the coffin of British Imperialism.",

  " Impact of Appointment of Simon",
  "Commission on the National Movement",
  "The impact of the appointment of the Simon Commission",
  "on Indian politics was two-fold:",
  "(i) It gave a stimulus to radical forces demanding not",
  "just  complete  independence  but  major  socio-economic",
  "reforms on socialist lines. When the Simon Commission was",
  "announced,  the  Congress,  which  did  not  have  any  active",
  "programme in hand, got an issue on which it could once again",
  "forge  mass  action.",
  "(ii)  The  challenge  of  Lord  Birkenhead  to  Indian",
  "politicians to produce an agreed constitution was accepted",
  "by various political sections, and thus prospects for Indian",
  "unity seemed bright at that point of time.",
  " The Simon Commission Recommendations",
  "The Simon Commission published a two-volume report in",
  "May  1930.  It  proposed  the  abolition  of  dyarchy  and  the",
  "establishment of representative government in the provinces",
  "which should be given autonomy. It said that the governor",
  "should  have  discretionary  power  in  relation  to  internal",
  "security and administrative powers to protect the different",
  "communities. The number of members of provincial legislative",
  "council  should  be  increased.Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 361",
  "The report rejected parliamentary responsibility at the",
  "centre. The governor-general was to have complete power to",
  "appoint the members of the cabinet. And the Government of",
  "India would have complete control over the high court.",
  "It also recommended that separate communal electorates",
  "be  retained  (and  extended  such  electorates  to  other",
  "communities)  but  only  until  tensions  between  Hindus  and",
  "Muslims  had  died  down.  There  was  to  be  no  universal",
  "franchise.",
  "It accepted the idea of federalism but not in the near",
  "future; it suggested that a Consultative Council of Greater",
  "India  should  be  established  which  should  include",
  "representatives  of  both  the  British  provinces  as  well  as",
  "princely  states.",
  "It suggested that the North-West Frontier Province and",
  "Baluchistan should get local legislatures, and both NWFP and",
  "Baluchistan should have the right to be represented at the",
  "centre.",
  "It recommended that Sindh should be separated from",
  "Bombay, and Burma should be separated from India because",
  "it was not a natural part of the Indian subcontinent.",
  "It  also  suggested  that  the  Indian  army  should  be",
  "Indianised  though British forces must be retained. India got",
  "fully equipped.",
  "But by the time the report came out, it was no longer",
  "relevant because several events overtook the importance of",
  "its  recommendations.",
  "Nehru  Report",
  "As an answer to Lord Birkenhead\u2019s challenge, an All Parties",
  "Conference  met  in  February  1928  and  appointed  a  sub-",
  "committee under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru to draft",
  "a constitution. This was the first major attempt by the Indians",
  "to  draft  a  constitutional  framework  for  the  country.  The",
  "committee included Tej Bahadur Sapru, Subhash Bose, M.S.",
  "Aney, Mangal Singh, Ali Imam, Shuab Qureshi and G.R.",
  "Pradhan as its members. The report was finalised by August",
  "1928. The recommendations of the Nehru Committee were",
  "unanimous except in one respect\u2014while the majority favoured",
  "the  \u201cdominion  status\u201d  as  the  basis  of  the  Constitution,  a",
  "section of it wanted \u201ccomplete independence\u201d as the basis,362 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "with the majority section giving the latter section liberty of",
  "action.",
  " Main Recommendations",
  "The  Nehru  Report  confined  itself  to  British  India,  as  it",
  "envisaged the future link-up of British India with the princely",
  "states on a federal basis. For the dominion it recommended:",
  "(i) Dominion status on lines of self-governing dominions",
  "as the form of government desired by Indians (much to the",
  "chagrin of younger, militant section\u2014Nehru being prominent",
  "among them).",
  "(ii) Rejection of separate electorates which had been",
  "the basis of constitutional reforms so far; instead, a demand",
  "for joint electorates with reservation of seats for Muslims",
  "at the Centre and in provinces where they were in minority",
  "(and not in those where Muslims were in majority, such as",
  "Punjab and Bengal) in proportion to the Muslim population",
  "there with right to contest additional seats.",
  "(iii)  Linguistic  provinces.",
  "(iv) Nineteen fundamental rights including equal rights",
  "for women, right to form unions, and universal adult suffrage.",
  "(v) Responsible government at the Centre and in pro-",
  "vinces\u2014",
  "(a) The Indian Parliament at the Centre to consist of",
  "a 500-member House of Representatives elected on the basis",
  "of  adult  suffrage,  a  200-member  Senate  to  be  elected  by",
  "provincial councils; the House of Representatives to have a",
  "tenure of 5 years and the Senate, one of 7 years; the central",
  "government to be headed by a governor-general, appointed",
  "by the British government but paid out of Indian revenues,",
  "who would act on the advice of the central executive council",
  "responsible  to  the  Parliament.",
  "(b) Provincial councils to have a 5-year tenure, headed",
  "by a governor acting on the advice of the provincial executive",
  "council.",
  "(vi) Full protection to cultural and religious interests",
  "of  Muslims.",
  "(vii)  Complete  dissociation  of  State  from  religion.",
  " The Muslim and Hindu Communal",
  "Responses",
  "Though the process of drafting a constitutional framework",
  "was begun enthusiastically and unitedly by political leaders,Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 363",
  "communal  differences  crept  in  and  the  Nehru  Report  got",
  "involved  in  controversies  over  the  issue  of  communal",
  "representation.",
  "Delhi  Proposals  of  Muslim  League",
  "Earlier, in December 1927, a large number of Muslim leaders",
  "had met at Delhi at the Muslim League session and evolved",
  "four proposals for their demands to be incorporated into the",
  "draft constitution. These proposals, which were accepted by",
  "the Madras session of the Congress (December 1927), came",
  "to be known as the \u2018Delhi Proposals\u2019. These were:",
  " joint electorates in place of separate electorates with",
  "\u25cf",
  "reserved  seats  for  Muslims;",
  "one-third  representation  to  Muslims  in  Central",
  "\u25cf",
  "Legislative Assembly;",
  " representation to Muslims in Punjab and Bengal in",
  "\u25cf",
  "proportion  to  their  population;",
  " formation of three new Muslim majority provinces\u2014",
  "\u25cf",
  "Sindh, Baluchistan and North-West Frontier Province.",
  "Hindu Mahasabha Demands",
  "The Hindu Mahasabha was vehemently opposed to the proposals",
  "for creating new Muslim-majority provinces and reservation",
  "of seats for Muslims majorities in Punjab and Bengal (which",
  "would ensure Muslim control over legislatures in both). It",
  "also demanded a strictly unitary structure. This attitude of",
  "the Hindu Mahasabha complicated matters.",
  "Compromises",
  "In  the  course  of  the  deliberations  of  the  All  Parties",
  "Conference, the Muslim League dissociated itself and stuck",
  "to its demand for reservation of seats for Muslims, especially",
  "in the central legislature and in Muslim majority provinces.",
  "Thus, Motilal Nehru and other leaders drafting the report",
  "found themselves in a dilemma: if the demands of the Muslim",
  "communal opinion were accepted, the Hindu communalists",
  "would withdraw their support, if the latter were satisfied, the",
  "Muslim leaders would get estranged.",
  "The concessions made in the Nehru Report to Hindu",
  "communalists  included  the  following:",
  " Joint electorates proposed everywhere but reservation",
  "\u25cf",
  "for Muslims only where in minority;364 \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b A Brief History of Modern India",
  "  Sindh  to  be  detached  from  Bombay  only  after",
  "\u25cf",
  "dominion status was granted and subject to weightage given",
  "to Hindu minority in Sindh;",
  "  Political  structure  proposed  broadly  unitary,  as",
  "\u25cf",
  "residual  powers  rested  with  the  centre.",
  " Amendments Proposed by Jinnah",
  "At the All Parties Conference held at Calcutta in December",
  "1928 to consider the Nehru Report, Jinnah, on behalf of the",
  "Muslim League, proposed three amendments to the report:",
  "(i) one-third representation to Muslims in the central",
  "legislature;",
  "(ii) reservation  to  Muslims  in  Bengal  and  Punjab",
  "legislatures proportionate to their population, till",
  "adult suffrage was established; and",
  "(iii) residual  powers  to  provinces.",
  "These demands were not accommodated.",
  "Jinnah\u2019s  Fourteen  Points",
  "Jinnah went back to the Shafi faction of the Muslim League",
  "and  in  March  1929  gave  fourteen  points  which  were  to",
  "become the basis of all future propaganda of the Muslim",
  "League. The fourteen points were as follows.",
  "1.  Federal  Constitution  with  residual  powers  to",
  "provinces.",
  "2. Provincial autonomy.",
  "3. No constitutional amendment by the centre without",
  "the concurrence of the states constituting the Indian federation.",
  "4. All legislatures and elected bodies to have adequate",
  "representation of Muslims in every province without reducing",
  "a majority of Muslims in a province to a minority or equality.",
  "5. Adequate representation to Muslims in the services",
  "and in self-governing bodies.",
  "6.  One-third  Muslim  representation  in  the  central",
  "legislature.",
  "7. In any cabinet at the centre or in the provinces, one-",
  "third to be Muslims.",
  "8.  Separate  electorates.",
  "9. No bill or resolution in any legislature to be passed",
  "if three-fourths of a minority community consider such a bill",
  "or  resolution  to  be  against  their  interests.Simon Commission and the Nehru Report  \u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b\u272b 365",
  "10.  Any  territorial  redistribution  not  to  affect  the",
  "Muslim majority in Punjab, Bengal and NWFP.",
  "11. Separation of Sindh from Bombay.",
  "12. Constitutional  reforms  in  the  NWFP  and",
  "Baluchistan.",
  "13. Full  religious  freedom  to  all  communities.",
  "14. Protection  of  Muslim  rights  in  religion,  culture,",
  "education and language.",
  " Nehru Report Found Unsatisfactory",
  "Not only were the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha and",
  "the Sikh communalists unhappy about the Nehru Report, but",
  "the younger section of the Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "and Subhash Bose were also angered. The younger section",
  "regarded the idea of dominion status in the report as a step",
  "backward, and the developments at the All Parties Conference",
  "strengthened  their  criticism  of  the  dominion  status  idea.",
  "Nehru and Subhash Bose rejected the Congress\u2019 modified",
  "goal and jointly set up the Independence for India League.",
