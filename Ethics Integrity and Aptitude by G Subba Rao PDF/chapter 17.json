  "INTRODUCTION ",
  "The functions of government fall into two broad heads: legal exercise of authority and provision ",
  "of services. Modern states are welfare states and provide a wide range of public services to their ",
  "citizens. The services cover areas such as education, health, housing and transport. Services ",
  "also include such requirements as a driving license, telephone connection, gas connection, tax ",
  "refund, Aadhaar card, passport, and extracts from public records of one\u2019s property, educational ",
  "qualification and date of birth. Citizens often experience considerable difficulty in securing timely, ",
  "reliable and quality services from government agencies. Citizen Charters are a means of solving ",
  "the day to day problems which citizens experience while dealing with organisations providing ",
  "public services. ",
  "The Conservative party government under John Major was the first to introduce the citizen\u2019s ",
  "charter (1991). Citizen\u2019s Charters seek to continuously improve the quality of public services for ",
  "the people so as to respond to their needs and wishes. Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government relaunched ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charters in 1998 under the name \u201cServices First\u201d. ",
  "The six principles of the Citizen\u2019s Charter movement as originally framed were: ",
  "(i)  Quality: Improving the quality of services; ",
  "(ii)  Choice: provision wherever possible; ",
  "(iii)  Standards: Specifying what to expect and how to act if standards are not met; ",
  "(iv)  Value: For the taxpayers\u2019 money; ",
  "(v)  Accountability: Of Individuals and Organisations; and ",
  "(vi)  Transparency: Of Rules/Procedures/Schemes/Grievances. ",
  "The Labour Government later expanded them into the following nine principles of Service ",
  "Delivery: ",
  "(i)  Set standards of service; ",
  "(ii)  Be open and provide full information; ",
  "(iii)  Consult and involve;  ",
  "17.2   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "(iv)  Encourage access and promote choice; ",
  "(v)  Treat all fairly; ",
  "(vi)  Put things right when they go wrong; ",
  "(vii)  Use resources effectively; ",
  "(viii)  Innovate and improve; ",
  "(ix)  Work with other service providers. ",
  "The UK\u2019s Citizen\u2019s Charter initiative was followed by similar programmes in other countries ",
  "like Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, Portugal, and Spain. Some of ",
  "these adopted the service quality model of the \u201cTotal Quality Management\u201d (TQM) movement. For ",
  "improving public services, some countries used methods such as the Business Excellence Model, ",
  "Charter Mark and ISO 9000. ",
  " ",
  "THE INDIAN SCENARIO ",
  "At a Conference of Chief Ministers held on 24 May, 1997 an \u201cAction Plan for Effective and Responsive ",
  "Government\u201d at the Centre and State levels was adopted. It was decided that the Central and State ",
  "Governments would formulate Citizen\u2019s Charters, starting with those sectors that have a large public ",
  "interface (e.g., Railways, Telecom, Posts, Public Distribution Systems and the like). ",
  "The Charters have to cover various aspects of an organization. We discuss them below. ",
  " ",
  "Vision and Mission Statements ",
  "The Citizen\u2019s Charter should begin with a clear statement of vision. Vision reflects the final objectives ",
  "of an organization and the manner in which it seeks their achievement. A clear vision helps an ",
  "organization to plan for and achieve its goals. The vision of an organization should be known to its ",
  "personnel and the citizens it serves. Public bodies have to prepare their vision through a consultative ",
  "process, involving multiple points in the organization as well as citizens, client groups or stakeholders. ",
  "This will ensure that the vision will have considerable acceptability. ",
  "Mission Statement ",
  "The \u2018mission\u2019 statement outlines the specific objectives which propel the organization in tune with ",
  "its vision. An organization needs to think of the manner in which the vision is to be realised. This ",
  "would help it in framing the mission in concrete rather than in vague terms. ",
  "Identification of Services ",
  "The Charter should clearly specify the services, which an organization would provide to attain its ",
  "mission and vision. This should list all the services, which would be made available through its various ",
  "agencies. Some Charters give information about \u2018details of business transacted by the organization\u2019. ",
  "An agency may use other expressions like \u2018Our Function\u2019, or \u2018Our Duties and Responsibilities\u2019. But ",
  "the main point is that all services should be clearly mentioned in the Charter. ",
  "Identification of Levels ",
  "Organizations operate at multiple levels; depending on the allocation of responsibilities and authority, ",
  "particular levels deal with specific client groups/users/stakeholders. Irrespective of whether the  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.3 ",
  "organizations mention \u2018details of business\u2019, \u2018commitments\u2019, \u2018functions\u2019 or \u2018services\u2019 in their charters, ",
  "there should be a clear identification of the levels at which specific services would be provided. ",
  "Citizens/clients will know the levels at which they can access a specific service and not waste their ",
  "time and energy in locating the service delivery point. The charter should make it clear whether it ",
  "applies to all the agencies that come under the Ministry or Department or the agencies have their ",
  "own specific Charters. ",
  "Identification of Client Groups/Stakeholders/Users ",
  "A citizen charter has to clearly mention its client groups/stakeholders/users. This will lead to better ",
  "service and greater interaction with them. One common weakness of citizen charters is their failure ",
  "to clearly identify the client groups/stakeholders/users with reference to the services offered. This ",
  "deficiency needs to be remedied. Sometimes organizations will not have specific client groups with ",
  "whom they have regular dealings. Some organizations may have direct clients, who pay for the ",
  "service accessed. But others may have users who may access the service by virtue of being citizens. ",
  "In some cases, despite not being the users of a service, citizens or groups may feel concerned about ",
  "the organizational decisions as they have to bear the fall-outs of the decisions, as in case of many ",
  "decisions related to industrial or mining projects, which affect the local people even if they are not ",
  "users or clients. But public organizations have to respond to all citizens irrespective of their status ",
  "as their clients. ",
  "Big organizations with many client groups may have different services for different client ",
  "groups. In such a situation, the Charter should list out the services for each client group and the ",
  "\u2018commitments\u2019 for each of such services. This can be fine tuned further by listing out the specific ",
  "\u2018commitments\u2019 at each level of the organization and the \u2018commitments\u2019 in terms of the special ",
  "client groups like the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, religious minorities and weaker sections. ",
  "Specification of Time-Frames for Each Service ",
  "The charter has to show the time by which a particular service will be provided. By mentioning ",
  "the time, the organization will prevent undue public expectations and can work within reasonable ",
  "schedules. Citizens can plan things from their end, and look for alternatives where available. Evidently, ",
  "some services are perennial. Examples are services which Department of Telecommunications, ",
  "Indian Railways, Department of Posts and Department of Drinking Water Supply provide. However, ",
  "even here services like delivery of post, payment of postal deposits, and installation of telephone ",
  "connections and reservation/cancellation of reservation of railway tickets can be time bound. ",
  "Specification of Time-Frames at Each Level ",
  "Time-frame for service delivery is required for each level at which specific services are delivered. ",
  "They need to be observed. Ideally, organizations should publish information showing the extent of ",
  "adherence to time-frames at each level. Public sharing of a comparative picture of service delivery ",
  "from various levels in the organization is likely to introduce competition and improve performance. ",
  "Specification of Service Quality Standards ",
  "Organizations have to show the service quality standards in the charters. Based on this information, ",
  "citizens can look for other available sources of service or may seek enhancement of the proposed  ",
  "17.4   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "standards. Organizations can also exercise internal controls based on their declared standards. ",
  "While declaring standards, organizations have to follow both public policy requirements and clients\u2019 ",
  "interests. For example, in passport delivery, clients prefer speed, but public policy interest requires ",
  "proper scrutiny. ",
  "Specification of Service Delivery Standards ",
  "Citizen charters need to include clear commitment on service delivery standards such as timeliness, ",
  "access, accuracy, reliability, affordability, responsiveness, fairness, sensitivity, and courtesy. These ",
  "standards should be stated in the form of commitments and not simply as targets. Standards have ",
  "to be measurable so that the organization can concretely present its performance. Standards should ",
  "be widely publicized and made known to people thorough suitable media advertisements. ",
  "Providing Information about the Public Grievance Redressal Procedures ",
  "Grievance redressal helps an organization in correcting its functioning. The charter should encourage ",
  "the citizens/clients to ventilate their grievances. It should clearly lay down the grievance redressal ",
  "procedures so that citizens/users/clients/stakeholders who have any grievances can seek redressal. This ",
  "mechanism has to be taken seriously since unsolved citizen problems can damage an organization\u2019s ",
  "image. ",
  "Providing Information about the Public Grievance Redressal Mechanisms ",
  "Citizens need to be informed about the grievance redressal mechanism available to them at various ",
  "levels in the organization. A senior officer should be made responsible for inviting and processing ",
  "\u2018grievances\u2019 for redressal. His/her name, designation, office room and telephone numbers and e-mail ",
  "address should appear in the Charter. The officer in-charge of the grievances should ensure that they ",
  "are received, diarized, acknowledged in a day or two and examined. Organizations should have ",
  "mechanisms such as a committee for review, weekly or monthly meetings with concerned officers ",
  "at various levels and reports on the number and type of grievances received. ",
  "Information about the Time-frame for the Public Grievance Redressal ",
  "Time limit for looking at complaints is an important item in the citizen\u2019s charter. The time-frame ",
  "laid down for grievance redressal should be realistic and has to be observed by the organization. ",
  "Otherwise, the system will lose credibility. A complaint may finally be accepted or rejected. If a ",
  "complaint is rejected, the reasons for its rejection have to be clearly stated. A provision for appeal ",
  "should be made for those citizens who still want to pursue their complaint after its rejection. ",
  "To summarize, a Citizen\u2019s Charter includes: vision and mission statements; identification of ",
  "services; identification of levels; identification of client groups/ stakeholders/users; specification ",
  "of time-frames for each service; specification of time-frames at each level; specification of service ",
  "quality standards; specification of service delivery standards; and providing Information about ",
  "the grievance redressal procedures. ",
  "To be effective, citizen\u2019s charters need to give clear information on the following aspects: ",
  "\u00a4  Processes/ Procedures for accessing services including about forms and charges ",
  "\u00a4  Contact points for reaching service providers including addresses,  telephones and ",
  "e-mail  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.5 ",
  "\u00a4  Location and functions of Information Facilitation Counters (IFCs) ",
  "\u00a4  Handbook on the scheme brought out under the RTI Act, 2005 ",
  "\u00a4  Monitoring mechanism for citizen\u2019s charter ",
  "\u00a4  Procedure for receiving suggestions and comments from public ",
  " ",
  "ASPECTS OF A CITIZEN\u2019S CHARTER ",
  "Rationale ",
  "A Citizen\u2019s Charter expresses the understanding between citizens and the provider of a public ",
  "service. The service provider is usually the government department or the agency which provides ",
  "the particular service. If the service is outsourced to a non government agency, that agency becomes ",
  "the service provider. For example, a birth certificate may be provided by a village panchayat or a ",
  "municipality or a city corporation. A citizen charter mentions the quality of service and the time for ",
  "its delivery. It is a statement about the rights of the public and the obligations of the public servants. ",
  "Citizens have a right to a particular quality of service which meets their needs and is provided ",
  "efficiently at a reasonable cost. The Citizen\u2019s Charter is a written, voluntary declaration by service ",
  "providers. It specifies the level, quality or standard of the relevant services. It indicates the ",
  "alternatives open to people or whether they can get similar services from other service providers. ",
  "The charter indicates the procedure through which citizens can get the service from its provider. ",
  "It assures that all eligible persons will be served in a non discriminatory manner. The relevant ",
  "details about the service are made public and fully disclosed to ensure transparency. Its details ",
  "are placed in the public domain so that all can know about it. Nothing about it is kept secret ",
  "or hidden. Finally, a Citizen\u2019s Charter contains accountability clauses. It specifies the persons ",
  "responsible for providing the services, and whom the citizens can approach for redressal if they ",
  "fail to get the service as promised. ",
  "Citizen\u2019s charter borrows the idea of customer service from the private sector. No business can ",
  "survive without a satisfied customer base. Successful businesses focus on product quality, after ",
  "sales service and redressal of customer complaints. Citizen\u2019s Charters represent one application of ",
  "the concept of reinventing government on the managerial model of successful private enterprises. ",
  "In this model, the service providing department or its official is assigned the role of a manager. The ",
  "citizens are treated as the customers of the department for that service. The service becomes the ",
  "product which the department provides. The quality of service resembles the product standards ",
  "of the business terminology. ",
  "This model of service delivery also seeks to change the attitudes of government servants. ",
  "Traditionally, government servants in India have considered themselves as agents exercising ",
  "government power. They like to lord it over people. The service delivery model casts government ",
  "servants in a different role as providers of services to people. They have to render service with ",
  "sympathy and ensure public satisfaction. People pay taxes and government servants, while ",
  "providing services, have to ensure that people get value for their money. ",
  "The Citizen\u2019s Charter should not make promises which it cannot deliver. It should mention ",
  "those services which are permissible according to the programme or policy guidelines and  ",
  "17.6   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "within available resources. It should not consist only of assurances or vague promises. It should ",
  "adopt suitable procedures based on the nature of the service. The citizen charter is a set of ",
  "ideas to raise the level of standards and service delivery and increase public participation, in ",
  "the most appropriate way. If properly implemented, the Charter will promote transparency and ",
  "accountability. ",
  "A Citizen\u2019s Charter can lead to: ",
  "\u00a4  Improved service delivery; ",
  "\u00a4  Greater responsiveness of officials towards the public; and ",
  "\u00a4  Greater public satisfaction with services. ",
  " ",
  "Steps in formulation ",
  "Following steps are necessary for preparing a citizen\u2019s charter. ",
  "(i)  Formation of Task Force consisting of the concerned officials for preparing the charter ",
  "(ii)  Listing the major services which the Organization will provide and those who will be ",
  "provided the services (clients or customers in business terminology) ",
  "(iii)  Consultation with Clients/Stakeholders/Staff (Primarily at cutting-edge level or ",
  "implementation level) and their representative  associations ",
  "(iv)  Preparation of Draft Charter ",
  "\u2022  Circulating the draft charter to all concerned for getting their comments/ suggestions; ",
  "\u2022  Revising the Charter after considering the suggestions ",
  "(v)  Consideration of the Charter by Core group (Core group is another group of officials ",
  "which makes a peer review of the charter) ",
  "(vi)  Modification of Charter by the Ministry/Department on the basis of suggestions/ ",
  "observations of the Core Group ",
  "(vii)  Approval by the Minister-in-charge ",
  "(viii)  Submission of a copy of the charter to the Department of Administrative Reforms and ",
  "Public Grievances (In State governments, the copy will be sent to the State Administrative ",
  "Reforms  department) ",
  "(ix)  Formal issue/release of Charter and uploading it on website ",
  "(x)  Sending copies to People\u2019s Representatives and all stakeholders ",
  "(xi)  Appointment of a Nodal Officer to ensure effective implementation ",
  " ",
  "Model Guidelines ",
  "The purpose of a Citizen\u2019s Charter is to reduce the dissatisfaction of the citizen/consumer/ customer ",
  "with the quality of service which government departments and public sector entities provide. To ",
  "serve this end, Citizen Charter documents should adopt the following guidelines. ",
  "(i)  The Charter must be simple. ",
  "(ii)  While preparing the Citizen\u2019s Charter, senior officers or experts must consult both cutting ",
  "edge staff who will implement it and the citizens (or their representative organisations) who ",
  "will use it.  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.7 ",
  "(iii)  Merely pasting the Citizen\u2019s Charter on an office notice board or wall will not produce ",
  "attitudinal change in the service staff. The necessary climate has to be generated through ",
  "regular training and motivation of staff. ",
  "(iv)  The Charter should clearly enumerate the services on offer. ",
  "(v)  Against each available service, the Charter should mention the persons eligible for it, the ",
  "entitlement of the user, service standards and remedies available to the user in case of ",
  "breach of standards. ",
  "(vi)  Procedures for availing the services and the payable charges should be shown on website/ ",
  "display boards/ booklets/ inquiry counters. ",
  "(vii) It should be made clear that all attempts will be made to provide the services as indicated in ",
  "the Charter, but that they are not justiciable (or cannot be enforced by courts). ",
  "(viii) The Charter should contain provisions for getting feedback (experiences of users), performance ",
  "audit (which shows whether the services are being delivered as promised in the charter) and a ",
  "schedule for reviewing the Charter every six months based on experience. ",
  "(ix)  If an organization provides distinct services, separate Charters can be prepared for each ",
  "distinct service area. ",
  "General Structure ",
  "We have already mentioned the components of Citizen\u2019s Charters. More broadly, the Charter should ",
  "begin with a brief statement about the services to be delivered. It has to mention the public interface ",
  "of the service, for example, ticket reservation or passenger amenities in Railways, mail delivery, or ",
  "premium services of postal department. The commitment to standards will specify the time limits ",
  "and quality of service. The Charter will specify the staff or the service deliverers \u2014 where they can be ",
  "found and what to expect of them. The Charters have to keep the people informed and especially ",
  "consider the information they are likely to need for availing the service. The Charter has to consider ",
  "any problem that may lead to failure of service delivery, and inform people about whom to contact in ",
  "such contingencies and what help they can get from the personnel designated for this purpose. The ",
  "Charter can mention how citizens can help the organization with their suggestions or in other ways. ",
  "Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for Implementing the Charters ",
  "Based on its experience with the implementation of Citizen\u2019s Charters, the Administrative Reforms ",
  "department has formulated the following positive and negative guidelines for their implementation. ",
  "1.  Proceed steadily. ",
  "2.  List areas of interface. ",
  "3.  Introduce the Charter through small steps. ",
  "4.  Involve customers and staff in formulating and implementing the Citizen Charters. ",
  "5.  Prepare a Master Plan for formulation and implementation of Charter over five years along ",
  "with a budget for the period. ",
  "6.  Win consumer confidence with small, highly visible measures. ",
  "7.  Be ready to introduce changes in the Charter based on experience. ",
  "8.  Inform people of the proposed commitments.  ",
  "17.8   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "9.  Use simple language. ",
  "10.  Train the concerned staff. ",
  "11.  Delegate powers. ",
  "12.  Set up systems for feedback and independent scrutiny. ",
  "The following errors have to be avoided while preparing the Charters. ",
  "\u00a4  Rushing with the Charters ",
  "\u00a4  Being  unrealistic ",
  "\u00a4  Taking on excessive commitments ",
  "\u00a4  Top-down formulation and implementation without inputs from operational levels ",
  "\u00a4  Preparing a package for the whole  Ministry/Department/Organization ",
  "\u00a4  Promising more than what one can do ",
  "\u00a4  Looking upon any Citizen Charter as a one-time exercise, with a final outcome ",
  "\u00a4  Informing the citizens before one is ready to deliver the service ",
  "\u00a4  Centralization ",
  "\u00a4  Continuing blindly without regular periodic reassessment of performance ",
  " ",
  "Features of a Good Charter ",
  "The elements of a good Charter are: ",
  "(i)  Focus on Customer Requirements; ",
  "(ii)  Simple Language; ",
  "(iii)  Service Standards; ",
  "(iv)  Effective Remedies; ",
  "(v)  Training; ",
  "(vi)  Delegation; ",
  "(vii)  Feedback  Mechanism; ",
  "(viii)  Close Monitoring; ",
  "(ix)  Periodic Review. ",
  " ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Expectations ",
  "Citizens have the following expectations from Government Departments/Service Providers: ",
  "(i)  Reliability or consistency in performance; ",
  "(ii)  Responsiveness or timely service; ",
  "(iii)  Credibility or having customer interest at heart; ",
  "(iv)  Empathy or attention to customer\u2019s needs; ",
  "(v)  Courtesy and care or physical evidence of willingness to serve. ",
  "To sum up, the six principles of Citizen\u2019s Charters are: published standards; openness and clarity ",
  "of information; choice and consultation; courtesy and helpfulness; redress when things go wrong; ",
  "and value for money.  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.9 ",

  "LET US JOIN HANDS IN MAKING THIS CHARTER A   SUCCESS! ",
  "Working of Citizen\u2019s Charters ",
  "There have been various evaluations of Citizen\u2019s Charters. The findings have been generally negative. ",
  "But there have been notable successes too. Among the successful examples which find mention in  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.11 ",
  "an official document of the Ministry of Personnel are: Regional Transport Office, Hyderabad; Jan ",
  "Sewa Kendra, Ahmedabad; Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Chennai ",
  "and Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. However, there may be many ",
  "other success stories. At least, the concept of a citizen\u2019s charter is now firmly lodged in the minds of ",
  "governments and citizens. By January 2011, Central Government departments finalized 131 citizens ",
  "charters and state government departments finalized 729 Citizen\u2019s Charters. ",
  "In an early study which the Ministry of Personnel commissioned, the following weaknesses ",
  "were found. The impact of Citizen\u2019s Charters was reduced due to poor service delivery standards ",
  "and under-performance. There was inadequate feedback from citizens about quality of service, ",
  "limiting the impact of the Charter. The lack luster performance can be traced to various reasons ",
  "such as: ",
  "\u00a4  Absence of a planned approach to publicity ",
  "\u00a4  Limited training and stakeholder involvement ",
  "\u00a4  Charter as one among many initiatives ",
  "\u00a4  Bureaucratic style of functioning ",

  "Bill on the Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of Their ",
  "Grievances. ",
  "Government has since decided to pass a law laying down obligations of every public authority ",
  "towards citizens, specifying delivery of goods and services in a time-bound manner and providing ",
  "for a grievance redressal mechanism for non-compliance of Citizen\u2019s Charter. A Bill was introduced ",
  "in parliament in 2011 for this purpose. ",
  "Background ",
  "The Bill deals with two rights of citizens. One is time-bound delivery of goods and services. The ",
  "other is redressal of grievances. The Bill mentions Citizen\u2019s Charter; it is the document that defines ",
  "the standard of services which a public agency provides. It also gives the time limit for providing ",
  "the goods and services. ",
  "In 2007, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission recommended that Citizen\u2019s Charters ",
  "should stipulate penalties for non-compliance. In 2008, a parliamentary Standing Committee (on ",
  "Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice) recommended giving statutory status to grievance ",
  "redressal mechanisms. The Central Information Commission also recommended that grievance ",
  "redressal systems should be strengthened to reduce the public tendency to seek redressal of ",
  "their grievances through use of the Right to Information Act. It has been found that applicants ",
  "often resort to RTI Act not to get information but to have their problems resolved. The President, ",
  "in her address to Parliament in June 2009, stated that the government would focus on ensuring ",
  "effective delivery of public services. The Standing Committee that examined the Lokpal Bill, 2011 ",
  "recommended the creation of a separate legislation to deal with Citizen\u2019s Charters and grievance ",
  "redressal. The Parliament on August 27, 2011 while adopting the \u2018Sense of the House\u2019 Resolution ",
  "on Lokpal, agreed in principle to the establishment of a Citizen\u2019s Charter. Currently, government ",
  "departments deal with grievances internally. Persons may also approach the High Court through ",
  "writ petitions. Further, as on March 2012, several states had enacted laws providing for grievance ",
  "redressal mechanisms. ",
  "Main Provisions of the Bill ",
  "\u00a4  The Bill requires public authorities to publish a Citizen\u2019s Charter within six months of ",
  "enactment of the Bill. ",
  "\u00a4  The charter should specify the services and the quality of services to be provided by the ",
  "public authority. ",
  "\u00a4  The heads of departments are responsible for disseminating and updating the Citizen\u2019s Charter.  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.13 ",
  "\u00a4 Public authorities include: (a) constitutional and statutory authorities; (b) entities established ",
  "under any government notification; and (c) public-private partnerships. They also include ",
  "NGOs that are substantially government funded, government companies, and companies ",
  "that provide services under a licence or a statutory obligation. ",
  "\u00a4 Public authorities are required to establish Information Facilitation Centres for efficient and ",
  "effective delivery of services and redressal of grievances. Information Facilitation Centres ",
  "may include customer care centres, call centres, help desks and people\u2019s support centres. ",
  "Public Grievance Redressal Commissions ",
  "\u00a4 The Bill establishes Central and State Grievance Redressal Commissions. Each Commission ",
  "would consist of a Chief Commissioner and upto 10 Commissioners. The Commissioners ",
  "would be appointed by the President (Governor) on the recommendation of a selection ",
  "committee. ",
  "\u00a4 This committee would consist of the Prime Minister (Chief Minister), the Leader of the ",
  "Opposition in the Lok Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and a sitting Supreme Court (High ",
  "Court) judge. ",
  "\u00a4 The Commissioners should be: (a) present or former Secretaries to the central (state) ",
  "government; or (b) present or former Supreme Court judges or Chief Justices of a High ",
  "Court (district court judges for 10 years, or High Court judges); or (c) eminent persons with ",
  "at least 20 years (15 years) of experience in social sectors with a postgraduate degree in a ",
  "relevant sector. ",
  "\u00a4 The Commissioners may be removed by an order of the President (Governor) under certain ",
  "conditions. ",
  "Complaint Mechanism ",
  "Complaint: Any citizen may file a complaint covering: (a) failure in delivery of goods or services ",
  "listed in the Citizen\u2019s Charter; (b) the functioning of the public authority; and (c) any violation of a ",
  "law, policy, programme, order or scheme. Complaints have to be redressed within 30 working days. ",
  "Complaints have to be made to the Grievance Redressal Officer (GRO). GROs are to be ",
  "appointed by each public authority at the central, state, district, sub-district, municipality and ",
  "panchayat levels. ",
  "\u00a4 The GRO is required to: (a) ensure that grievances are redressed within 30 working days; (b) ",
  "ensure that disciplinary action is taken against a defaulting officer if he has acted negligently; ",
  "and (c) recommend penalties and compensation where an individual has wilfully neglected to ",
  "deliver services or there is a prima facie ground for a case under the Prevention of Corruption ",
  "Act, 1988. The GRO has to inform the complainant about the action taken on the complaint. ",
  "\u00a4 Appeal: The orders of the GRO may be appealed before the Designated Authority (DA). ",
  "The DA shall be an officer above the rank of the GRO and outside the concerned public ",
  "authority. ",
  "\u00a4 The DA shall dispose of appeals within 30 working days of their receipt. If a complaint with ",
  "the GRO is not redressed within 30 working days, the GRO has to forward it as an appeal ",
  "to the DA. The DA may penalize the defaulting officers.  ",
  "17.14   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "\u00a4 Second Appeal: The DA\u2019s orders may be appealed before the Central or State Public ",
  "Grievance Redressal Commission within 30 working days. Appeals relating to complaints ",
  "arising out of functioning of the central (state) departments would lie before the Central ",
  "(State) Commission. The Commissions have to dispose of the appeal within 60 working days. ",
  "\u00a4 Third Appeal: In relation to an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, an ",
  "appeal against the decision of the Commissions shall lie with the Lokpal or the Lokayukta. ",
  "\u00a4 Suo motu mechanism: The Central and State Commissions can suo motu refer matters ",
  "related to non delivery of goods and services to the heads of government departments. The ",
  "Commissions may also initiate suo motu inquiry if they believe that there are reasonable ",
  "grounds to inquire into the matter. ",
  "\u00a4 Complaints may also be made to the Commissions in certain cases. It is the duty of the ",
  "Commissions to inquire into complaints by persons: (a) who are unable to file appeals before ",
  "the DA; (b) who are refused redress of grievances; (c) whose complaints are not disposed ",
  "of within 30 days; and (d) who are denied access to the citizen\u2019s charter because it has not ",
  "been prepared or has not been widely disseminated. ",
  "Penalties ",
  "\u00a4 GRO: The Bill requires the GRO to recommend penalties to the DA when: (a) he is ",
  "convinced that the default was due to wilful neglect by an officer; or (b) when there is prima ",
  "facie evidence of corruption. ",
  "\u00a4 DA and Commissions: The Bill empowers the DA and the Commissions to impose a ",
  "maximum penalty of Rs 50,000 upon the defaulting officer and the GRO. Penalties may be ",
  "imposed upon the defaulting officer when he has acted in a malafide manner or has failed ",
  "to discharge his responsibility in a proper manner. A portion of the penalty may be awarded ",
  "as compensation to the complainant. ",
  "\u00a4 If there is evidence of corruption against the defaulting officer, the DA and the Commissions ",
  "would have to refer the matter to appropriate authorities. Additionally, the DA may initiate ",
  "proceedings in such cases. ",
  "\u00a4 Disciplinary proceedings may be initiated by the GRO, DA and the Commissions against ",
  "the defaulting officer if there is evidence of malafide action. ",
  "\u00a4 In any appeal proceeding, where it is alleged that the grievance has not been redressed by ",
  "the GRO, the burden of proof shall be on the GRO. ",
  "Main Issues ",
  "Critics have pointed out certain legal and other difficulties involved in the provisions of the bill. ",
  "These are briefly outlined below. ",
  "\u00a4 Parliament may not have the jurisdiction to regulate the functioning of state public officials ",
  "as state public services fall within the purview of state legislatures.  ",
  "Citizen\u2019s Charter   17.15 ",
  "\u00a4 This Bill may create a parallel grievance redressal mechanism as many central and state ",
  "laws have established similar mechanisms. ",
  "\u00a4 Companies that render services under a statutory obligation or a licence may be required ",
  "to publish Citizen\u2019s Charters and provide a grievance redressal mechanism. ",
  "\u00a4 The Commissioners may be removed without a judicial inquiry on an allegation of ",
  "misbehaviour or incapacity. This differs from the procedure under other legislations. ",
  "\u00a4 Appeals from the Commissions\u2019 decisions on matters of corruption will lie ",
  "before the Lokpal or Lokayuktas. The Lokpal Act has come into force recently, and some ",
  "Lokayuktas have not been established. ",
  " ",
  "   Summary ",
  " ",
  "\u00a4 The functions of government fall into two broad heads: legal exercise of authority and ",
  "provision of services. Modern states are welfare States and provide a wide range of public ",
  "services to their citizens. ",
  "\u00a4 The services cover areas such as education, health, housing and transport. Services also ",
  "include such requirements as a driving license, telephone connection, gas connection, ",
  "tax refund, Aadhaar card, passport, and extracts from public records of one\u2019s property, ",
  "educational qualification and date of birth. ",
  "\u00a4 Citizens often experience considerable difficulty in securing timely, reliable and quality ",
  "services from government agencies. ",
  "\u00a4 Citizen\u2019s Charters are a means of solving the day to day problems which citizens experience ",
  "while dealing with organisations providing public services. ",
  "\u00a4 The Conservative party government under John Major was the first to introduce the Citizen\u2019s ",
  "Charter (1991). ",
  "\u00a4 Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government relaunched Citizen\u2019s Charters in 1998 under the name ",
  "\u201cServices First\u201d. ",
  "\u00a4 The six principles of the Citizen\u2019s Charter movement as originally framed were \u2013 quality, ",
  "choice, standards, value, accountability and transparency. ",
  "\u00a4 A Citizen\u2019s Charter includes: vision and mission statements; identification of services; ",
  "identification of levels; identification of client groups/ stakeholders/users; specification of ",
  "time-frames for each service; specification of time-frames at each level; specification of service ",
  "quality standards; specification of service delivery standards; and providing information ",
  "about the grievance redressal  procedures. ",
  "\u00a4 Citizen\u2019s Charters represent one application of the concept of reinventing government on ",
  "the managerial model of successful private enterprises. In this model, the service providing ",
  "department or its official is assigned the role of a manager. The citizens are treated as the ",
  "customers of the department for that service. The service becomes the product which the ",
  "department provides. The quality of service resembles the product standards of the business ",
  "terminology.  ",
  "17.16   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "\u00a4  The service delivery model casts government servants in a different role as providers of ",
  "services to people. They have to render service with sympathy and ensure public satisfaction. ",
  "\u00a4  The Citizen\u2019s Charter should not make promises which it cannot deliver. ",
  "\u00a4  Steps in formulation of a Citizen\u2019s Charter have been covered earlier. ",
  "\u00a4  We have outlined the model guidelines for preparing the Citizen\u2019s Charters. ",
  "\u00a4  We have detailed earlier the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for Implementing the Charters. ",
  "\u00a4  We have given a model format for Citizen\u2019s Charter. Students can refer to it for background ",
  "and getting a feel of the charter. Its details are unimportant. ",
  "\u00a4 There have been various evaluations of Citizen\u2019s Charters. The findings have been generally ",
  "negative. As we have outlined the findings in the form of points, there is no need to repeat ",
  "them here. ",
  "\u00a4  Government introduced a Bill titled the Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods ",
  "and Services and Redressal of Their Grievances. ",
  "\u00a4  The main provisions of the Bill are: ",
  "(i)  Public authorities should publish a Citizen\u2019s Charter ",
  "(ii)  They have to specify the services and the quality of services to be provided. ",
  "(iii)  The heads of department are responsible for disseminating and updating the citizen\u2019s ",
  "charter. ",
  "(iv)  \u2018Public authorities\u2019 have been defined widely covering all public or public sponsored ",
  "service providers. ",
  "(v)  Information Facilitation Centres have to be set up by each public authority. ",
  "(vi)  The Bill establishes Central and State Grievance Redressal Commissions. ",
  "(vii)  The Commissioners would be appointed by the President (or by Governors in States) ",
  "on the recommendation of a selection committee. ",
  "(viii)  The Bill contains a mechanism for dealing with complaints. ",
  "(ix)  There is a provision for three appeals. ",
  "(x)  There are provisions for penalties. ",
  "(xi)  In relation to an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, an appeal ",
  "against the decision of the Commissions shall lie with the Lokpal or the Lokayukta. ",
  "(xii)  We have outlined some of the issues likely to arise from the system envisaged in the ",
  "Bill. ",
