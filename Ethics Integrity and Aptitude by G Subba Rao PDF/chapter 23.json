  "Data is a character from Star Trek: the Next generation. He resembles a super smart computer without ",
  "any feelings. \u201cData seeks to feel, knowing that something essential is missing. He wants friendship, loyalty; like the ",
  "Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, he lacks a heart. Lacking the lyrical sense that feeling brings, Data can play music ",
  "or write poetry, with technical virtuosity, but not feel its passion. The lesson of Data\u2019s yearning for yearning itself is ",
  "that the higher values of the human heart\u2014faith, hope, devotion, love\u2014are missing entirely from the cognitive [purely ",
  "intellectual] view. Emotions enrich; a model of mind that leaves them out is impoverished.\u201d   \u2013Daniel Goleman ",
  " ",
  "INTRODUCTION ",
  "The expression \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019 may itself seem to be a contradiction. In the history of ",
  "philosophy, the terms \u2018appetites\u2019, \u2018passions\u2019 and \u2018emotions\u2019 are used as opposites of \u2018reason\u2019, \u2018intellect\u2019 ",
  "and \u2018understanding\u2019. Philosophers saw a sharp dichotomy between the two sides \u2013 emotional and ",
  "intellectual \u2013 of human mental life. They felt that emotions cloud human understanding and lead ",
  "men astray. For them, as for saints, moral endeavour was a never-ending effort to bring momentary ",
  "emotions and passions, often selfish, under the control of reason. This strain of thought continues ",
  "to be a perennial theme in practical ethics. ",
  "However, philosophers have also recognised that a strong character grounded in sound ethics is ",
  "necessary for pursuit of good. Otherwise, good people with weak minds and convictions will succumb ",
  "to the forces of evil. Modern thinkers proceeded further and recognised many emotions as good per ",
  "se. Thus, a mother\u2019s love for her children, a soldier\u2019s heroism, and a scholar\u2019s commitment to his ",
  "vocation \u2013 all these are intrinsically good emotions. These emotions are spontaneous and have no ",
  "other motives underlying them. ",
  "Even other emotions, though not as noble as the previously mentioned ones, can prove effective ",
  "in daily personal life, social relations, and business management and in public administration. For  ",
  "23.2   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "these functional purposes, we have to change our normal emotional responses and mind-set or ",
  "mental makeup. ",
  " ",
  "Intellectual Abilities ",
  "Before beginning our discussion on emotional intelligence, we may note that the skill sets which ",
  "public servants require fall into three distinct, though not watertight, categories. The first set consists of ",
  "intellectual abilities. These are subdivided into mathematical, logical, and verbal skills. Mathematical ",
  "and logical strands are more or less identical. They are essential for analyzing problems, understanding ",
  "their quantitative dimensions and for structured thinking. These are the intellectual qualities which ",
  "computer programmers, mathematicians and statisticians are likely to possess. ",
  "Verbal skills denote the ability to speak and write clearly and lucidly. They are the skills of ",
  "oral and written communication. Literary writers and critics \u2013 such as Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, TS ",
  "Eliot and Samuel Johnson \u2013 possess them in abundant measure. But hardly anyone can match the ",
  "standards of these writers. However, we can try to express our thoughts simply, directly and clearly ",
  "without pretentiousness and artificial props. These skills are extremely important for civil servants ",
  "since government business is transacted on files in the form of letters and notes. Furthermore, civil ",
  "servants nowadays have to make computer-aided oral \u2018presentations\u2019 on various  subjects. ",
  " ",
  "Moral Qualities ",
  "The second type of skills consists of moral qualities suited for government servants. These are the ",
  "core virtues which should form part of the moral outlook of an ideal civil servant. Codes of ethics ",
  "and codes of conduct embody such desired moral behaviour. Of course, it will be more appropriate ",
  "to describe these as morals than skills. ",
  " ",
  "Emotional Intelligence ",
  "The third skill set in the repertoire of civil servants can be called \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019. This is ",
  "a term coined by American scholars. These are the qualities which influence an officer\u2019s personal ",
  "behaviour and his interactions in the course of his official work with people, both within and outside ",
  "his organization. Many management theorists emphasise that these personal and social skills of ",
  "officers contribute to increased organizational effectiveness. Empirical research studies have shown ",
  "that emotional intelligence contributes far more than academic intelligence to an individual\u2019s success ",
  "in management, profession and administration. ",
  " ",
  "BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ",
  "Intelligence Quotient (IQ) ",
  "The term IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a score on a test that measures an individual\u2019s cognitive ability ",
  "in comparison to the general population. IQ tests use a standardized scale with 100 as the median ",
  "score. The following table shows roughly how the scores reflect intelligence.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.3 ",
  " ",
  "Score in the test  Level of intelligence ",
  "90-100  Average or normal ",
  ">130  Exceptionally high ",
  "<70  Very poor or retarded ",
  "When children are given the test, their age and background is taken into account. IQ scores ",
  "tend to remain stable. Repeated practice makes no significant difference to scores. ",
  "IQ tests are designed to measure general ability to solve problems and understand concepts. ",
  "These in turn include reasoning ability, problem-solving ability, and ability to perceive relationships ",
  "between things and ability to store and retrieve information. IQ tests measure various aspects of ",
  "general intellectual ability from diverse angles. They usually focus on: ",
  " ",
  "Ability  Main component ",
  "Spatial  Visualize/ manipulate shapes ",
  "Mathematical  Solve problems and use logic ",
  "Language or linguistic  Complete sentences or recognise words in which letters ",
  "are removed or rearranged ",
  "Memory  Recall visuals shown or things spoken ",
  "Questions in each of these categories measure a specific cognitive ability. Some psychologists ",
  "believe that each category also reflects general intellectual ability. ",
  "For over hundred years, intelligence meant only the scores of intelligence tests. They were ",
  "considered adequate measures of human intelligence. Intelligence meaning cognitive skills as shown ",
  "by IQ was considered an innate unalterable natural endowment. Being naturally given, it is a fixed ",
  "quality; study and industry may increase the absorption of information, but make no difference to ",
  "one\u2019s native intelligence. Practice at best may increase the speed of acquisition and manipulation of ",
  "information. ",
  "During World War I, the intelligence tests which the Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman ",
  "developed were extensively used in army recruitment. They created the IQ way of thinking. ",
  "Intelligence was seen as one dimensional or as a monolithic quality. Even now, Scholastic Aptitude ",
  "Test used to admit students to prestigious or Ivy League American universities, is a test of intellectual ",
  "skills. This is also true of other educational tests like GRE and GMAT. ",
  "Seven Varieties of Intelligence ",
  "Howard Gardner, a famous educational psychologist working at Harvard University, questioned ",
  "the conventional method of measuring intelligence as a single, one-dimensional skill and as the only ",
  "golden key to success in life. He spoke of multiple intelligences, and included emotional qualities ",
  "which lead to success in professions and life as among the components of \u2018intelligence\u2019. This is a  ",
  "23.4   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "radical departure from earlier approaches which conceived intelligence (comprising mathematical, ",
  "logical and linguistic skills) as a purely cerebral quality. ",
  "Howard Gardener outlined his views in Frames of Mind. He mentions that a single type of ",
  "intelligence is inadequate for success in life. He goes on to identify seven varieties of intelligence ",
  "including the usually recognised intellectual skills. We show them in the following table. ",
  " ",
  "Type of intelligence  Related activity  Great practitioners ",
  "Mathematical/logical  Solving structured problems  Newton, Gauss, Russell, ",
  "Einstein, Raman ",
  "Linguistic  Literature  Milton, James Joyce and ",
  "Goethe, Tagore ",
  "Spatial visualization  Painting, architecture and  Raphael, Michelangelo, ",
  "artistic design  Louis Corbusier ",
  "Kinaesthetic genius  Physical fluidity and grace as in  Larisa Latynina, Anna ",
  "classical dance and Olympic  Pavlova, Birju Maharaj ",
  "gymnastics ",
  "Musical  Great classical musical  Mozart, Beethoven, ",
  "compositions of West and East  Tansen, Thyagaraja ",
  "Interpersonal  Interpersonal skills of great leaders  Mahatma Gandhi, ",
  "intelligence  Abraham Lincoln ",
  "Intrapersonal  Great insights into human psyche;  Sigmund Freud, ",
  "intelligence  and finding inner peace through  Au r o b i n d o , B u d d h a ",
  "    adapting oneself to one\u2019s ",
  "    true feelings ",
  " ",
  "Emotional Intelligence ",
  "We have deliberately cited men of great eminence to give striking examples and fix the ideas in ",
  "the minds of students. There are many common people who embody similar skills starting from ",
  "humble teachers to struggling but dutiful housewives. The main point to note is the way in which ",
  "Howard Gardener expands the concept of intelligence. He includes in intelligence talents that ",
  "lead to cultural activities such as literature, art, music, painting and architectural design. He also ",
  "includes talents involved in sports and games. Finally, he adds interpersonal skills or social skills ",
  "and the insights men gain by looking into themselves and the mental feelings of others. Emotional ",
  "intelligence refers mainly to \u201cpersonal intelligences\u201d that help in getting along well with people and ",
  "in prudently ordering one\u2019s life.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.5 ",
  "We will now further elaborate the concepts used in explaining emotional intelligence. Daniel ",
  "Goleman explains emotional intelligence as consisting of \u201cabilities such as being able to motivate oneself ",
  "and persist in the face of frustrations; to control impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one\u2019s moods and keep ",
  "distress from swamping the ability to think; to empathize and hope.\u201d We can regard these as positive qualities ",
  "which help us in steadfastly pursuing goals which ultimately lead to success and happiness. Except ",
  "empathy, the other qualities are directed towards one\u2019s own self. Before proceeding further, we will ",
  "illustrate these ideas with simple examples. ",
  " ",
  "Case Studies ",
  "CASE 1 ",
  "Shekhar is doing a BBA program in a middle-tier management school in the USA, and has ",
  "aspirations to do an MBA from a top 10 level Business School and to eventually join the management ",
  "consulting profession. He is in the last but one semester and so far his grades have been in line with ",
  "his expectation. In the present semester, he has two marketing courses and he could not do well in ",
  "the first term paper of both the courses, in particular, he has got poor grades from an Indian origin ",
  "professor. The professors while evaluating the term papers have given extensive comments and ",
  "listed suggested readings. ",
  "Shekhar is feeling nervous about the next term papers. The topics are already selected by him ",
  "and now he has to research and write. He is not able to concentrate as he is anticipating failure in ",
  "getting admission to a management school of his choice set for MBA programme. Whenever he ",
  "starts reading fresh material from new resources as suggested by the professors the \u2018rejection letter\u2019 ",
  "from Graduate School comes to his mind. ",
  "Question ",
  "Imagine you are one of Shekhar\u2019s close friends. What do you think is Shekhar\u2019s problem and what ",
  "would be your advice to him? ",
  "1.  Marketing is perhaps not a subject in which Shekhar could be good at. In the next semester, ",
  "he should not take any of that stuff. ",
  "2.  Indian origin professors in USA think too high of themselves and are an alienated class and ",
  "Shekhar should avoid doing courses with Indian origin professors. ",
  "3.  Shekhar should absolutely focus on the current semester, act on the advice coming from ",
  "professors, and not worry about eventual rejection from Graduate Schools. ",
  "4.  Shekhar should realise that even without going to a select set of Graduate Schools, he could ",
  "do well in life. ",
  " ",
  "Discussion ",
  "The answer choice (1) reflects a hasty conclusion. Shekhar is in the last leg of the BBA programme ",
  "and must have done marketing courses earlier. At that time he got good grades. So there is no ",
  "problem with his aptitude for the subject. Moreover, the present anxiety results from one term paper ",
  "in each of the two courses. One should not read too much into this initial hiccup.  ",
  "23.6   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "The second answer choice is obviously wrong based as it is on illicit generalisation of a class ",
  "of eminent people. Moreover, Shekhar has not got good evaluation from the other professor who ",
  "surely is not of Indian origin. Shekhar should not try to find malice in others but reflect on the real ",
  "weakness of the papers he has produced. Such fault finding is always self-defeating. ",
  "The answer choice (3) is appropriate. Anxiety functions in two ways. A mild anxiety to do well ",
  "on a task enables one to summon all the physical and mental energy towards doing that task well. ",
  "An overdose of anxiety however, has a damaging effect in so far as it creates fear of failure thus ",
  "depriving the individual of the necessary power of concentration to do the task in a superb or even ",
  "orderly manner. Shekhar obviously has a surfeit of anxiety which he needs to control. ",
  "Shekhar\u2019s second problem is that that he has started thinking of failure and its eventual ",
  "consequences. He should live in the present time, keeping the goal in view though. Present time ",
  "demands that he concentrates on the necessary readings and follows the advice of the professors in ",
  "letter and spirit. He should not worry about graduate school admission at this time. ",
  "The answer choice (4) is a correct observation about life and its infinite possibilities. But the ",
  "observation does not tell what Shekhar should and should not do. Hence, this is an inappropriate ",
  "answer choice. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 2 ",
  "Pavitran is reading about the Indian economy. His teacher told him that the falling rupee is a most ",
  "likely question either in the \u2018Civil Services Mains Examination\u2019 or in interview if he makes to it. ",
  "Pavitran was wrestling with CAD, FII sell off, RBI\u2019s squeeze on money supply, rising yields on ",
  "government securities, mounting losses to banks and other arcane details of the monetary economy. ",
  "He was struggling to grasp the concepts and understand the links between them which he was told ",
  "explain the rupee\u2019s downward journey. But his mind kept moving off to a far more enchanting ",
  "scene. Pavitran is a great fan of the Southern movie queen Sunita. He always watched her movies ",
  "on a \u2018first-day-first-show-basis\u2019. But this time around, he was forced to accord higher priority to stories ",
  "of rupee\u2019s travails. While he was settling down to his study, his friend Armugam who watched the ",
  "newly released Sunita starrer Trichy Junction told him that that her item number in it was simply mind ",
  "blowing. Pavitran found Sunita\u2019s imagined dance postures and gyrations floating alongside the CAD ",
  "numbers and the bond yield curves. He wondered whether it would be best to watch the movie or ",
  "at least the dance number to get the whole distracting business out of his head. ",
  "Question ",
  "Assume that you are Pavitran\u2019s elder brother with whom he shares intimate thoughts and concerns. ",
  "At this time what would be your advice to Pavitran? ",
  "1.  Knowing that Sunita\u2019s curvaceous figure keeps Pavitran obsessed for days after he has seen ",
  "the movie, he should altogether avoid thinking about Sunita and not allow Armugam to ",
  "discuss this film and its details. ",
  "2.  This being one time distraction, Pavitran might well watchthe movie and leave it at that. ",
  "3.  Pavitran should focus on studies as the mains examination is near and it is a very important ",
  "examination. ",
  "4.  Both (1) and (3)  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.7 ",
  "Discussion ",
  "There is nothing very unique or perverse in Pavitran\u2019s mental state. Many young men (women) ",
  "develop fascination about heroines (heroes) popular in the celluloid. It is acceptable if there is an ",
  "artistic appreciation and strong liking of the role played by some actress or actor. But the trouble ",
  "starts when one falls in morbid love with lights and shadows on the screen. Since Pavitran has ",
  "such a condition and since the mains examination is not far it is good for him if he can avoid the ",
  "distraction. He can see the movie after the examination gets over if not in a cinema hall but certainly ",
  "on TV screen. ",
  "It is also necessary that he learns to discipline himself from the temptations of instantaneous ",
  "self-gratification. Emotionally mature individuals are able to postpone gratification of desire and ",
  "concentrate on the immediate challenges. ",
  "Such distractions sometimes have an infectious quality. One friend starts a discussion about ",
  "heroines and this or that dance sequence, sexual appeal etc. and everybody joins the rally. It is ",
  "also good to cut oneself off from such company at least till the time exam is over \u2013 without being ",
  "unpleasant or rude. ",
  "Thus answer choice (1) is appropriate. ",
  "One might think that no great a loss would follow if Pavitran just spends three hours for Trichy ",
  "Junction. The issue is not that. The issue is whether Pavitran is able to set his priority right looking ",
  "to his tasks at hand. The issue is also whether he has the emotional capability to delay gratification ",
  "whatever it is worth. Today it is Trichy Junction and Sunita, tomorrow there could be something ",
  "else. To be a winner in such a difficult examination, he has to cultivate the right temperament or ",
  "aptitude. From that perspective answer choice (2) is not acceptable. ",
  "Answer choice (3) is based on pure rationality. Powerful emotions or urges need moderation ",
  "by reason. That is the essence of suggestion in (3). It is appropriate. ",
  "Hence (4) is the right answer choice. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 3 ",
  "Akshay Pande is preparing to take the State Level Forest Services examination. He had a background ",
  "of physics and chemistry in graduation but now for this examination he has to be proficient in ecology. ",
  "He is trying hard to understand the legal framework which governs management of biosphere ",
  "reserves and national parks and other contemporary issues. The examination is three months away ",
  "and before two weeks his mother has developed some health problems for which the consulting ",
  "physician has advised Catscan to be sure about whether there is a cancerous growth causing the ",
  "present problem. In the family, she is the only lady managing household affairs. So, Akshay is not ",
  "able to concentrate on his studies all the time thinking whether his mother has got cancer and if so ",
  "what will be the consequences as the disease unfolds. He has started feeling that there is no hope ",
  "for success in the examination this time. ",
  "Question ",
  "What is your assessment of Akshay\u2019s emotional problem? ",
  "1.  It does not make sense to talk about his emotional problem. His apprehensiveness is ",
  "understandable as cancer, after all, is a deadly disease and most of the time incurable.  ",
  "23.8   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "2.  Akshay does not need to presume at this time that his mom has got cancer. If that is something ",
  "going to happen worrying will not prevent its occurrence. ",
  "3.  Losing hope is the worst thing that can happen to an aspirant in a competitive examination. ",
  "Hope is a strong motivator. By losing hope one guarantees failure. ",
  "4.  Both (2) and (3) ",
  " ",
  "Discussion ",
  "The fact that cancer is a deadly disease is well-known. Some anxiety therefore, is not out of place ",
  "or context. However, this anxiety should not get out of control and pervade Akshay\u2019s mind. At this ",
  "time, at worst that is a possibility but diagnosis is yet to come. He should not think it is given and ",
  "sure. One outstanding Guru of positive thinking, Norman Vincent Peale, used to pray that God ",
  "give us the capacity to distinguish between situations where our actions matter and where they do ",
  "not. We need to focus all our energy on the first set of conditions and accept the second. Calm ",
  "acceptance is the first step necessary before looking for solution. Worrying about cancer at this time ",
  "cannot change the diagnosis and therefore, not much thought should be given to the possibility ",
  "except trying to get the tests done from the right place and getting the right medical advice. Thus ",
  "answer choice (1) is not correct but (2) is appropriate. ",
  "The point made in (3) is apt. In the west, scholars have made many studies about the temperament ",
  "and behavior of Olympic winners and great sports stars. Great champions share a common mindset ",
  "in that they have high hopes about eventual success. That goes to explain how great sports persons ",
  "come back to win even after initial setback in a competitive event. They quickly analyse the causes ",
  "of setback, make immediate adjustment and start the next round with renewed vigour never ever ",
  "losing hope. Akshay is losing hope for no good reason. He must not allow that to happen. Hence ",
  "answer choice (3) makes a valid point. ",
  "Thus (4) is the right answer choice. ",
  " ",
  "Gardener\u2019s Summary ",
  "After these illustrations, we give two brief summaries which Howard Gardener gave of his thoughts ",
  "on emotional intelligence. ",
  "Interpersonal intelligence is the ability to understand other people: what motivates them, how they work, how to ",
  "work cooperatively with them. Successful sales people, politicians, teachers, clinicians, and religious leaders are all likely ",
  "to be individuals with high degrees of interpersonal intelligence. Intrapersonal intelligence \u2026 is a correlative ability, ",
  "turned inward. It is a capacity to form an accurate, veridical [true] model of oneself and to be able to use that model ",
  "to operate effectively in life. ",
  "In another formulation, Howard Gardener mentions that the core of interpersonal intelligence includes \u201cthe ",
  "capacities to discern and respond appropriately to the moods, temperaments, motivations, and desires of other people\u201d. ",
  "In intrapersonal intelligence, the key to self-knowledge, he included, \u201caccess to one\u2019s own feelings and the ability to ",
  "discriminate among them and draw upon them to guide behaviour.\u201d ",
  "Howard Gardener\u2019s approach to intelligence has remained cognitive. He emphasises that one ",
  "should understand the motives and habits of work of others so that one can get along better with ",
  "them. His focus is also on self-understanding so that one can live a productive and happy life. This ",
  "approach is based partly on the doctrine of behaviourism \u2013 first propounded by Watson and made  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.9 ",
  "popular in 1960s by B.F. Skinner. They argued that only behaviour which is observable can be a ",
  "subject of scientific study. As we know, science deals with matters which are observable, measurable ",
  "and verifiable. Human behaviour, such as blushing, can be studied by observing physiological changes ",
  "i.e. change of skin colour of cheeks. However, we cannot observe feelings and things going on in ",
  "the minds of people. Hence, behaviourists banished study of mental life from science. However, ",
  "Howard Gardener included them in his studies. ",
  "Some psychologists like Thorndike recognised the concept of social intelligence. He regarded ",
  "social intelligence as one aspect of emotional intelligence. Social intelligence is the ability to understand ",
  "others and to act wisely in human relations. However, in the 1960s, the mainstream psychologists ",
  "were sceptical of the concept of social intelligence and thought it useless. As we saw, the tide turned ",
  "with the advent of Gardener\u2019s ideas. Changes in business environment, as we shall see, also brought ",
  "emotional intelligence to the fore. ",
  "Emotional Intelligence Theory ",
  "Two psychologists, Peter Salovey and John Mayer, proposed a comprehensive theory of emotional ",
  "intelligence in 1990. Daniel Goleman has also written extensively on emotional intelligence. Daniel ",
  "Goleman has conceptualized emotional intelligence on the basis of five main aspects. ",
  "Self-awareness ",
  "This is the ability to accurately assess our feelings at any given time, and to take decisions according ",
  "to our preferences. Another dimension of self-awareness consists in making a realistic assessment of ",
  "our capabilities and acquiring an adequate degree of self confidence. ",
  "Self-regulation ",
  "This aspect implies control over emotions so that they help and do not hinder the task at hand; it ",
  "also implies sincerity of purpose and the willingness to delay gratification of tempting immediate ",
  "pleasures; finally it means that one is able to bounce back quickly from emotional stresses. ",
  "Motivation ",
  "This involves relying on our strongest preferences to guide and move us towards our cherished goals; ",
  "it strengthens and encourages our drives towards self-improvement; and it makes us persevere even ",
  "when faced with heavy odds and grim prospects. ",
  "Empathy ",
  "This is the ability to sense what others are feeling; it enables one to look at things from the perspective ",
  "of others; it implies readiness to have rapport and adapt to diverse groups of people. ",
  "Social skills ",
  "These consist in the ability to handle emotions in relationships; accurately understanding social ",
  "situations and networks; behaving smoothly with people; using these skills to lead and persuade; to ",
  "negotiate and resolve disputes; and to promote cooperation and team work.  ",
  "23.10   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "The above aspects of emotional intelligence virtually cover the whole of one\u2019s personal, ",
  "social and official life. They apply to children, youth and the aged. An enormous literature ",
  "has developed covering emotional competencies and their applications in different contexts of ",
  "life. But for our purposes it is sufficient to consider the essential points and their applications ",
  "especially in work situations. We present cases to show how aspects of emotional intelligence ",
  "or competence come into play in work situations. These are also known as soft skills. Students ",
  "should learn the process of analyzing situations using concepts of emotional intelligence. ",
  "Changes in Business Environment and Emotional Intelligence ",
  "In recent years, emotional intelligence has become a major topic in management studies. Its emergence ",
  "marks a major shift in thinking. Earlier managerial models, based on hierarchical systems, placed ",
  "senior executives on a high pedestal. The boss used to keep his distance from his subordinates fearing ",
  "that familiarity would breed contempt and lower discipline. Sensing the emotions of the subordinates ",
  "was considered dysfunctional. For generally organizational goals differed from personal goals, ",
  "and trying to satisfy individual aspirations or needs interfered with realisation of an organization\u2019s ",
  "objectives. The personal feelings of employees did not matter. Top managers were reluctant to lend ",
  "their ears to \u201csob stories\u201d. ",
  "We live in a different business world now. The twin forces of globalization and information ",
  "technology have radically transformed the operating environment of businesses. This transformation ",
  "also altered the emotional environment within organizations. Corporate heads are no longer the ",
  "\u2018manipulative, jungle fighter\u2019 stereotypes. They can no longer produce results by dominating or ",
  "ordering subordinates around. They have to be virtuosos in interpersonal skills. Senior managers ",
  "have to understand the feelings of their subordinates who are to be treated as fellow workers. They ",
  "have to prevent differences from escalating and enable people to comfortably \u2018move with the flow\u2019 ",
  "in organizations. ",
  "In any organization, work is done cooperatively in a team. Nowadays, the teams are ",
  "made up of knowledge workers with specialized skills. In these situations, managers have to ",
  "evaluate the work done by others and offer constructive criticism for its improvement. This is ",
  "an everyday activity in any organization at almost all levels. But managerial behaviour ",
  "here is marked by common dysfunctionalities. Managers fail to clearly indicate specifically ",
  "how to improve any piece of work produced by subordinates. They criticise the work in ",
  "general terms without indicating any line of improvement and launch personal attacks on ",
  "subordinates, laced with malicious comments. Such behaviour creates among subordinates ",
  "confusion, resentment and a tendency to avoid work and contact with the manager. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 4 ",
  "After completing post graduation in economics and statistics, Ramana Rao was compelled by family ",
  "circumstances to join a periodical as assistant to a sub-editor. The periodical specialised in doing ",
  "racy stories on politics, social scandals, and film stars, with occasional pieces on the economic misery ",
  "sweeping the society. Ramana Rao carefully studied books on economic journalism and on current ",
  "state of Indian economy as background knowledge needed for his job. He was conscientious and  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.11 ",
  "worked hard on the economic news items. Having studied in Telugu medium, he found it hard to ",
  "get rid of certain mannerisms which crept into his writing. Further, his math background made it ",
  "hard for him to handle woolly generalities and gushy emotions. ",
  "His boss Velayudham was from a brash, investigative news background. He scoffed at Ramana ",
  "Rao\u2019s factual writing referring to it as watery tea or Sambar without masala. Ramana Rao pleaded ",
  "that it is hard to wring emotion out of economic news. Velayudham dismissed the pieces as lacking ",
  "in punch and kick. Ramana Rao\u2019s occasional \u2018Telugish\u2019 bits, he said, were screamingly hilarious. ",
  "He often taunted Ramana for his humble origin and rural background. Ramana Rao was miserable ",
  "and would have quit but for economic compulsions. But his luck changed. Vasanthi, the owner\u2019s ",
  "niece, returned after graduating from London School of Economics, and became the subeditor. She ",
  "discussed matters with her uncle and changed the tone of the stories. Though a hard taskmaster, ",
  "she clearly told Ramana Rao about the slant and the main content of the stories. She made some ",
  "changes, but after consulting him. She liked the stories loaded with facts and figures which Ramana ",
  "Rao wrote. ",
  "Question ",
  "In contrast to the style of well-educated Vasanthi, what intellectual shortcoming and emotional ",
  "pathology do you notice in Velayudham as supervisor of Ramana Rao? ",
  "1.  No deficiency or pathology are evident, Velayudham is only trying to supply what the Indian ",
  "market with poor taste (generally speaking) wants. ",
  "2.  Velayudham has no grasp of the fact that economic journalism cannot be given the robe ",
  "and trappings of masala stories about socialites or film stars. ",
  "3.  As a supervisor he is failing to provide workable guidance. Moreover, oblique reference to ",
  "one\u2019s family background in business or official environment is crude and distasteful. ",
  "4.  Both (2) and (3) ",
  " ",
  "Discussion ",
  "As regards answer choice (1) there is substance in the statement that a substantial segment of our ",
  "readers indeed have poor taste and they are interested in inane and juicy stories. However, economics ",
  "and the study of an economy are analytical subjects. These matters cannot be put in the same style ",
  "of narration as done in gossip market \u2013 except in certain contexts such as investigation of financial ",
  "fraud or scandals. But that is a small part of the whole ambit of economic analysis. Velayudham is ",
  "failing to understand this essential distinction of themes: film story vs. economic analysis. Not only ",
  "that, he is stepping into the forbidden territory of social and economic background of an employee. ",
  "This kind of behavior assumes the hue of discrimination and in worst cases will be regarded as ",
  "human rights violation. All managers need to be careful about these implications of behaviour more ",
  "so because they occupy position of authority. Thus answer choice (1) is not acceptable. ",
  "From the previous discussion, you can easily appreciate that observations in (2) and (3) are ",
  "valid. It is also the duty of Velayudham to direct efforts of Ramana along the lines that market ",
  "demands. There may be less scope of doing that in economic journalism, but some avenues do ",
  "exist. For example, interesting and readable stories can be written on the theme of farmers\u2019 suicide  ",
  "23.12   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "due to distress in agrarian economy. Aligning efforts of staff towards the goal of the business is a ",
  "key responsibility which Velayudham is failing to discharge. ",
  "Therefore, (4) is the correct answer choice. ",
  " ",
  "Art of Criticism ",
  "Harry Levinson mentions that the work of employees working under a manager should be criticised ",
  "in the following way: ",
  "Specificity ",
  "As we noted earlier, a critic has to be specific. He can use an example or cite an incident to show ",
  "the area in which the work falls short or the pattern of its deficiency. He should point to the areas ",
  "which need reworking and the way of going about it. He should not be indirect or delicate, but ",
  "should call a spade a spade so that others get the message. ",
  "Providing solutions ",
  "If possible, the group leader should offer a solution. This is the usual counter to critics: If you think ",
  "that things are in a mess, tell us how to set them right. When subordinates are merely criticised ",
  "without being told how to mend their work, they get frustrated, disheartened and demotivated. One ",
  "need not give them a fully worked out solution; they can be told of the other possibilities, alternatives ",
  "or ways of advance. One may pinpoint the areas of deficiency or the manner of addressing errors. ",
  "Face to face contact ",
  "Though some people revel in running down others to their face, many others tend to avoid such ",
  "unpleasant encounters. But it is best to criticise and praise people in their presence. Sending a long ",
  "note of criticism or praise will not have the same impact as a one to one talk. It promotes dialogue, ",
  "reduces distance and forces managers to squarely face up to their responsibilities. ",
  "Empathy ",
  "As we have noted, managers have to avoid a carping or belly-aching note in criticism. Criticism ",
  "should be based on empathy or on understanding sympathetically the viewpoint of others. Otherwise, ",
  "it will breed ill-will. Daniel Goleman says of destructive criticism: \u201cinstead of opening a way for a ",
  "corrective, it creates an emotional backlash of resentment, bitterness, defensiveness, and distance.\u201d ",
  "Levinson also gives the following advice to those at the receiving end of the criticism: ",
  "\u00a4  Look upon it as a means of improvement, and not as a personal attack. ",
  "\u00a4  Avoid the tendency to defensiveness, cool down for a few days and discuss matters again ",
  "with your manager. ",
  "\u00a4  Consider criticism as an opportunity of working with your critic. ",
  " ",
  "Knowledge Workers and Work Teams ",
  "We now consider another feature of modern organizations which makes emotional intelligence vital ",
  "to their working. Emotional intelligence enhances the group IQ of an organization. Any organization ",
  "represents a pool of talent covering various subject areas like finance, marketing, quantitative analysis  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.13 ",
  "and creative design. Group IQ can be thought of as a summation of the IQs of individual workers. ",
  "Lack of emotional intelligence can bring down the group IQ. Prof MGK Menon used to say that ",
  "a single Indian worker matches or exceeds the skills of his Japanese counterpart; but two Indians ",
  "working together are far less productive than their Japanese counterparts. This shows the importance ",
  "of emotional intelligence in working together in groups. ",
  "Peter Drucker, the doyen among management theorists, coined the term \u2018knowledge worker\u2019 ",
  "and predicted that more than a third of the American work force would soon consist of knowledge ",
  "workers. He mentions that their productivity consists in adding value to information. Knowledge ",
  "workers are people such as financial analysts, writers and computer programmers. Their knowledge ",
  "is highly specialized and their productivity depends on their individual work getting integrated into ",
  "the work of a work team. For example, novelists are not publishers; and nor are hardware designers ",
  "sellers of computer parts. With knowledge work, team replaces the individual as the work unit. As ",
  "a result, emotional intelligence which comprises skills that promote harmonious group working has ",
  "become important. Studies have shown that efficiency of work teams is highly correlated with their ",
  "internal social harmony. Let us look at a case which shows how mutual rivalry and envy can derail ",
  "projects. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 5 ",
  "Prajapati is a Finance member in a team commissioned to prepare a project for seeking aid from a ",
  "foreign philanthropic fund. The project leader Mallick is an egoistic self-seeker who belittled other ",
  "team members, created an impression of being the sole driver of the project and generally hogged ",
  "the limelight. He never allowed anyone else from the team to visit abroad for discussions or to talk ",
  "to foreign donors. Being a smooth talker, he impressed people. Prajapati was a rank holder in CA ",
  "examination and resented Mallick\u2019s ways of ignoring other team members. Often, he differed from ",
  "Mallick. Mallick bypassed Prajapati and consulted his subordinates on how best to make the project ",
  "look attractive. In due course, the visit of the fund\u2019s appraisal team was fixed. While studying the ",
  "financials of the project, Prajapati realised that the calculations underlying its financial viability were ",
  "flawed. He felt that Mallick would lose face when the appraisal team spots the errors. He thought ",
  "that it would be a fitting lesson to Mallick. ",
  "Question ",
  "In the office drama narrated, what dysfunctional behaviour do you observe here? Point out at least ",
  "three significant remediable dysfunctionalities. ",
  "Discussion ",
  "The following style and/or conduct of Mallick and Prajapati are dysfunctional for their managerial ",
  "roles. ",
  "1.  Mallick\u2019s egocentric conduct is problematic. Apparently he has no real grasp of the intricacies ",
  "of project preparation and evaluation. Yet he wanted to demonstrate that he is leading from the ",
  "front. That too may be tolerated but he must keep some specialist on his side so that mistakes ",
  "are avoided. This he failed to do.  ",
  "23.14   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "2.  Mallick\u2019s second problem is his manipulative behaviour. He wanted to make the project appear ",
  "better than what it really was. Painting a project white is a common practice but one might do this ",
  "with great moderation. If lots of wrong assumptions are made and revenues are over exaggerated, ",
  "trained evaluators will be able to see through the deficiencies and the project proponents will ",
  "lose credibility. Then no foreign donor will be enthusiastic to provide aid. This Mallick should ",
  "have recognized and not pushed malleable subordinates to window dress the project. ",
  "3.  Prajapati should have been candid with Mallick and pointed out the flaws in the project proposal. ",
  "Whether Mallick would have listened to him or not, we cannot say. He should have pointed out ",
  "the deficiencies upfront; that action would have been in the interest of the organisation. Instead ",
  "Prajapati wished humiliation of Mr. Mallick in due course when the proposal gets rejected. This ",
  "approach is a deviation from team work and cohesive working in an organisation. Prajapati would ",
  "not at the end of the day gain anything from eventual rejection of the project. This is somewhat ",
  "akin to shooting at one\u2019s own feet. ",
  "New Management Tools ",
  "As we noted earlier, modern organisations can no longer be managed through handing down ",
  "commands. Management has to rely more on persuasion than on ordering people around. In this ",
  "situation, use of social skills for gaining influence and communicating ideas has become important. ",
  "The following are vital for this purpose: ",
  "\u00a4  Influence: Deploying suitable means of effective persuasion ",
  "\u00a4  Communication: Putting across messages clearly and  convincingly ",
  "\u00a4  Conflict management: Holding discussions and settling disputes  amicably ",
  "\u00a4  Leadership: Creating enthusiasm and giving direction to  subordinates ",
  "\u00a4  Acting as catalysts for change: Introducing, sustaining and managing change ",
  " ",
  "Influencing People ",
  "Influence involves winning over others to support our point of view. It may be hard to influence ",
  "people who have closed minds or absolutely rigid views. Sometimes, the differences are irreconcilable. ",
  "However, in many situations the aim is to persuade people to adopt one view instead of another. In ",
  "such situations, one has to present facts and arguments in a manner which will appeal to the listeners. ",
  "The matter has to be explained from their perspective, highlighting the advantages they will gain. ",
  "Open advocacy of a particular line, ignoring other alternatives, often leaves people unconvinced. ",
  "People have to be influenced indirectly. To gain influence, it is necessary to build coalitions and create ",
  "support. People are receptive to ideas conveyed through dramatic incidents and telling examples. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 6 ",
  "Manjit was asked to make a presentation to wholesale agents about the company\u2019s new product. ",
  "The communications team asked him to restrict the presentation to 20 minutes and 20 slides. They ",
  "added that no slide should have more than 5 lines. Manjit ignored the advice. He felt that under ",
  "these constraints no informative presentation could be made. As the Head of the communications was ",
  "away, Manjit had his way. But his presentation did not go well. He had 50 slides, each cluttered with  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.15 ",
  "data in small font and with no graphics. He droned on giving details on each slide. The wholesalers ",
  "began yawning. Many told him to keep it short and give them brochures on the product. ",
  "Question ",
  "What fault lines do you see in the emotional competence of Manjit? Point out at least three important ",
  "concerns. ",
  "Discussion ",
  "1.  Manjit failed to assess the taste, temperament and motivation of the wholesalers. The ",
  "wholesalers were having short attention span and were unable to absorb lots of information ",
  "in one session. As they were not interested in minor details, they started yawning. Manjit ",
  "did not adapt the presentation to the taste and requirement of his audience. ",
  "2.  His presentation lacked focus. The wholesalers are primarily interested in marketability of ",
  "the product, its price and their commission. These core concerns of wholesalers should have ",
  "been addressed. Major product features could have been narrated, but there is no need to ",
  "drown them in information. More the information presented, more likely the focus would ",
  "get lost. ",
  "3.  Manjit should have listened to the advice of the communication team. They specialise in ",
  "this subject and know how to make an effective presentation. In his enthusiasm and over ",
  "confidence, Manjit overlooked their advice and ended up making ineffective presentation. ",
  " ",
  "Communicating ",
  "Communication is a two way process. One has to take in the views of others attentively and sincerely. ",
  "One has to put across one\u2019s views clearly and unambiguously. In many situations, the mood of the ",
  "audience has to be accurately sensed, generally through their non verbal behaviour, and the message ",
  "has to be suitably worded. If any difficult questions crop up, they should not be avoided, but should ",
  "be addressed directly and honestly. It is essential to hear people and register what they are saying. ",
  "One should not mentally \u2018switch off\u2019 when others are speaking. Communication should aim at ",
  "mutual understanding. One-sided harangues have no communication value. In communications, ",
  "both sides should fully share the available information with each other. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 7 ",
  "Probir is the regional manager of the marketing department of a thriving business. The business has ",
  "been growing and the regional marketing office has recruited quite a few specialists recently. The ",
  "functional heads in the company have to meet their staff in an open meeting every two months. ",
  "Probir detested these meetings. It was open to everyone in the office. The staff came up with a long ",
  "list of trivial and tiresome complaints and grievances. They repeated the same things and spoke at ",
  "length. Even when the staff knew of the constraints, they went on with their complaints. They wanted ",
  "more space for lounge, for bathrooms and cr\u00e8che. Probir pointed to lack of space, and yet the staff ",
  "continued to complain. Probir cultivated a habit of sitting through the meeting with a cheerful face, ",
  "but with his mind switched off from the proceedings. The meeting became a tiresome ritual he had ",
  "to get through.  ",
  "23.16   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "Question ",
  "In Probir\u2019s situation what action would you have taken and why? ",
  " ",
  "Discussion ",
  "Probir needs to do the following gracefully: ",
  "1.  Since the business is thriving and more specialist staffers have been recruited, Probir should ",
  "expand office facilities quickly say within six-months. ",
  "2.  Till such time that office expansion takes place relieving the pressure on facilities, he should ",
  "seek a moratorium on discussion of the same old topic. ",
  "3.  He need not switch off in the meeting. These meetings serve a purpose. If he ignores all that the ",
  "staff members have to say, demotivation may set in. ",
  "The question focuses on understanding the needs of a team and the leader\u2019s role in resolution of ",
  "mundane problems of the team members. The source of the problem in this case is perhaps rooted ",
  "in the fact that success of the regional marketing function has brought forth induction of new team ",
  "members and the present accommodation has thereby become inadequate. This condition should ",
  "not be allowed to linger. If it does, dissatisfaction will surely result. He has to get rid of this core ",
  "problem. For this, he needs to develop a concrete plan of action and follow it up. After he reveals ",
  "the plan of action, team members will know that the problem will hopefully get resolved soon and ",
  "they would be willing to accept the moratorium. ",
  "Probir\u2019s boredom or frustration in listening to the same set of problems time and again is ",
  "understandable. He should have been proactive and anticipated the problem. However, problems ",
  "need resolution. Till the problems are resolved, the affected staff will keep raising them in meetings. ",
  "That means status quo. He has to break it. He has also to be attentive to what staff members say. ",
  "Carefully listening to a person and then solving his or her problem are marks of sincere concern for ",
  "that individual. Leaders in office need to show this quality. So he has to be attentive however much ",
  "he dislikes the grievances or narration thereof in the meetings. ",
  "Conflict Management ",
  "Conflict management is another skill that managers need. The conflicts here mean the quarrels and ",
  "disputes which frequently arise in organizations. They are not international or political conflicts. ",
  "Tact and diplomacy are the two means of handling such issues. The quarrels usually involve people ",
  "with difficult temperament and/or problematic situations. Auditors, Police and mediators often face ",
  "such situations. ",
  "It is useful to identify potential areas of conflict and the points of dispute. In any organization, ",
  "there are areas where functions overlap between two divisions. If the work is interesting, people will ",
  "try to grab it from others. [This is a form of turf war.] If it is tedious, they will try to dump it on others. ",
  "People get into bad moods and begin to have personal quarrels. Some mangers are antipathetic to ",
  "one another and there are cliques and groups. These problems afflict most organizations in some ",
  "measure. ",
  "The best way of addressing these problems is to bring them into open and arrange discussions ",
  "between the concerned people to iron out differences. Open and frank debate is the simple means ",
  "of settling such differences. Solutions have to be so devised as to satisfy all the parties to the dispute.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.17 ",
  "Managers have to scale down such disputes. Turning a blind eye or sweeping problems under the ",
  "carpet will allow them to fester. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 8 ",
  "Priya and Pinky are working in the finance wing. At one time, they were fast friends. But over a small ",
  "matter they quarrelled and fell apart. Their relationship turned hostile. Arun was their immediate ",
  "supervisor. He tried to patch things up but failed. Pinky and Priya did not hide their feelings even ",
  "before customers. As they dealt with two vital finance areas, they could not be kept away from ",
  "customer meetings. Arun met his boss and told him that the \u2018daggers drawn\u2019 situation between ",
  "the two ladies was creating problems. His boss responded by saying that he had no stomach for ",
  "mediating in a women\u2019s quarrel. ",
  "Question ",
  "From the standpoint of organisational behaviour and emotional intelligence what deficiencies do ",
  "you notice in the conduct of Arun\u2019s boss? ",
  "Discussion ",
  "First and foremost, Arun\u2019s boss (X in short) is ducking the issue. He cannot evade the issue, because ",
  "the quarrel is creating an embarrassment to the organisation. When customers get different vibes or ",
  "feel from different individuals in the organisation they lose trust and confidence in the organisation. ",
  "The result can be only one: loss of business. Both the employees Priya and Pinky need to be firmly ",
  "told about this organisational imperative. They should know that any such ugly show in future will ",
  "invite disciplinary action against both. ",
  "Second, X needs to delve deeper to know the root cause of the problem. Such conflicts may ",
  "rise from multiple reasons. The job description and duty assignment of two individuals may come ",
  "in conflict. Partiality shown by the immediate boss to one employee may be another trigger and ",
  "so forth. Talking to Priya, Pinky, Arun and others in confidence, X should be able to find the true ",
  "reason for this conflict. Sometimes it may be easy to resolve such conflict by purely organisational ",
  "measures such as defining job of individuals well so that no one treads into another\u2019s work domain. ",
  "Third, his comment shows sexist bias. His language presumes that women are prone to fighting ",
  "in this manner. That is an illicit generalisation. Sometimes men also fight in exactly the same way. ",
  "Managers or officers should clear their mind of such prejudice and refrain from using such language. ",
  "Leadership ",
  "Leadership in organisations involves inspiring and guiding individuals and groups. Leaders have to ",
  "formulate a shared vision and mission for the organisation. In working out the vision, they have to ",
  "involve others to create a sense of participation. Otherwise, the vision will fail to command allegiance. ",
  "Vision gives a sense of purpose which is a spur to human effort. People will not work if there is a ",
  "feeling of drift or aimlessness. Visions do not have to be grandiose. Small organisations and groups ",
  "can keep their sights lower. But some kind of vision gives direction to one\u2019s efforts. ",
  "Leadership naturally implies taking lead in doing things. Journalists often advise politicians to ",
  "assume leadership and get a grip on things. One cannot impose himself on others in the organization  ",
  "23.18   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "in the name of leadership \u2013 nor would others countenance such moves. Leadership is not merely an ",
  "attribute of one\u2019s position in an organisation. No one becomes a leader only by virtue of occupying ",
  "the top slot in the organisation. One has to show leadership qualities particularly by acting in difficult ",
  "times and by assuming responsibility for decisions that go wrong. Passing the buck to others in ",
  "troubled times is indefensible in any leader. Leaders have to decide matters democratically, not in ",
  "the sense of taking votes, but in the sense of consulting all concerned and examining all the relevant ",
  "technical inputs. ",
  "Most positions in an organisation involve leadership in greater or lesser measure. Except at the ",
  "lowest level, all positions involve supervision. Naturally, at the lower level, decisions will be simpler, ",
  "and involve fewer individuals. However, managers have to take initiative and be proactive in handling ",
  "problems. At any level, leaders should not play favourites. They need to evaluate performance of ",
  "everyone on the same criteria, avoiding subjectivity and personal likes and dislikes. They have to ",
  "be accessible equally to all subordinates and avoid creating any charmed circle of intimates. ",
  "Leaders have to act as catalysts for change. This is particularly critical now when many new ",
  "programmes and policies are being put on ground. New or innovative work methods change old ",
  "procedures and settled routines. They create unease since people in organisations are used to the ",
  "old ways. New processes involve what are known as learning curves which people have to traverse. ",
  "The process requires learning, effort, and \u201cgetting used to\u201d. Thus, computerising any office creates ",
  "tensions. Unlike the young who have learnt how to operate computers, many middle-aged employees ",
  "find the process troublesome. This explains the inertia of organisations in adopting to change. For ",
  "organisational leaders, this is a major challenge especially since the world and the workplaces are ",
  "being swept by rapid changes. ",
  "Leaders can manage change in the following ways: ",
  "\u00a4  They have to recognise the need for change and remove obstacles from its path. ",
  "\u00a4  They have to explain to others why the status quo is no longer viable. ",
  "\u00a4  They have to be vocal and open in pursuing change and form a group to drive the change. ",
  "\u00a4  They should adopt the new processes in their working and set an example to others. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 9 ",
  "Vishvambar was the transport commissioner in a progressive, happening State. Responding to ",
  "audit comments about loss of revenue and irregularities in vehicle registration centres and at toll ",
  "points, Government has introduced computer systems and CCTV cameras. A control centre was ",
  "created at State headquarters with real time data and image transfer. The new system evoked ",
  "strong opposition from vested interests within and outside government. Vishvambar studied ",
  "English literature in his college days. He had no background of computers. The whole process, ",
  "he confided to his close aides, went over his head. Fortunately, he had some officers who studied ",
  "in IITs. He left the whole matter to them. When asked to visit and supervise the control room ",
  "operations, he joked that the new fangled ideas are for the young and that it is difficult to teach ",
  "new tricks to an old dog.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.19 ",
  "Question ",
  "Select one of the following answer choices and give reasons why you accept or reject an answer choice. ",
  "1.  Vishvambar is over delegating. Technicalities need to be managed by specialist professionals ",
  "but he should know what\u2019s and why\u2019s of every important step or decision related to the ",
  "project from management perspective. ",
  "2.  In a responsible position such as Vishvambar is holding, the leader has a duty to be passionate ",
  "about major projects going on in the Department. By that test he is failing. ",
  "3.  Government has made a blunder in posting an officer with academic background in literature ",
  "into such technically intensive job as that of the transport commissioner. ",
  "4.  Only (1) and (2) ",
  " ",
  "Discussion ",
  "Answer choice (1) is correct, because it is clear from the behaviour of Vishvambar that he has ",
  "adopted hands off approach towards this project. Senior managers too need to \u2018make their hands ",
  "dirty\u2019 \u2013 struggling with the problems and the challenges. This process includes learning new subjects ",
  "(at least at the basic level) and acquiring new skill set. Apparently Vishvambar is unwilling to do ",
  "that for IT application in his department. ",
  "Obviously the project is an important one which is expected to bring transparency in functioning ",
  "of the department, reduce corruption and enhance state\u2019s revenue. He cannot avoid thinking about ",
  "the problems involved in IT application in his department because there are a few IITian employees ",
  "working for him. A project like this needs consideration not only of technical dimensions but also ",
  "others such as convenience of public in general in transacting business in the new format or system ",
  "and elimination of touts from the department. These matters concern general administration and ",
  "IT interface with people will be guided by these considerations. Vishvambar is failing to appreciate ",
  "how much a person who has eyes and ears open and acquaintance with affairs of common man\u2019s ",
  "life can contribute to the development of a good web based platform. He can make that contribution ",
  "only when he appreciates how the technology works. He does not have to become a designer or ",
  "software code writer for that purpose. In the context, therefore, his hands off approach is far from ",
  "being responsible. ",
  "In view of the discussion in the previous two paragraphs the answer choice (2) is also correct. ",
  "Answer choice (3) is definitely wrong. Academic background should not be the dominant ",
  "consideration in appointment of senior executives in Government. Yes, extraordinary achievement ",
  "in some field of relevance can and should be taken into account. There is no principle that a person ",
  "with literature or liberal arts background in University cannot be placed in a department which ",
  "has an IT intensive project. There have been many distinguished civil servants who have done ",
  "exceptionally well in a field in which she or he did not have previous exposure. It all depends on ",
  "motivation and passionate application. Background is never an insurmountable barrier for achievers ",
  "in management or civil services. Thus answer choice (3) is incorrect. ",
  "Hence (4)  ",
  "23.20   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "Programmes for Poor ",
  "We have so far discussed how emotional intelligence is necessary for increasing organisational ",
  "efficiency in the new knowledge-based global business environment. There is, however, another ",
  "aspect which is relevant to organizing and implementing welfare programmes for the deprived ",
  "groups. Government servants implement the programmes according to the prescribed guidelines. ",
  "But mere mechanical efficiency is inadequate for successful implementation of these programmes. ",
  "They need to show personal commitment to ensure that such programmes succeed. They have to ",
  "put their heart and soul into the effort. Programmes for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, women ",
  "and children fall into this category. ",
  "These programmes are hard to design and execute. Unlike other sectoral programmes, these ",
  "lack adequate infrastructure, committed and knowledgeable staff and suffer from low visibility. ",
  "They lack glamour. Government servants find it much harder to implement these programmes than ",
  "those in infrastructure or industry. This is true of all social and poverty alleviation programmes. ",
  "The client groups are poor, illiterate and unorganized. Unlike industrialists or project developers, ",
  "they have neither initiative nor drive. They can confer no benefits of any sort on government ",
  "servants. Government servants often view them as a troublesome burden, and seek transfers to ",
  "other departments. This is where young officers have to display idealism and compassion even at ",
  "the cost of undergoing some personal inconveniences. ",
  " ",
  "CASE 10 ",
  "Sen Gupta is working as a Sub divisional officer in Visakhapatnam. He married his childhood ",
  "friend Poornima Chaterjee. Poornima studied fine arts in college. They live in the city outskirts ",
  "near the beach. Poornima was delighted to find a cultural forum which organised cultural events ",
  "and concerts regularly. She attended all the programmes. The organisers were delighted at the ",
  "interest she showed and lavished attention on her. Meanwhile, government asked for volunteers to ",
  "serve in a remote, backward, tribal area. Sen Gupta, along with some others, volunteered, and was ",
  "transferred. Poornima was terribly upset that she would have to leave Visakhapatnam. She would ",
  "especially miss the cultural programmes. She chides Sen Gupta for his folly. ",
  "Question ",
  "From the standpoint of intimate interpersonal relationships examine each of the following answer ",
  "choices and give reasons why you accept or reject an answer choice. More than one choice may ",
  "be valid. ",
  "1.  Poornima is right; there is no point in volunteering for posting in a tribal area. Governments ",
  "are very poor in appreciating good work done in the face of challenges and hardships. ",
  "Then why to dive into such a situation knowing well that Poornima is enjoying stay in ",
  "Visakhapatnam? ",
  "2.  There is an idealist streak in Sen Gupta\u2019s personality or else why should he opt for such ",
  "posting? Poornima, being a friend of Sen Gupta from childhood days should have appreciated ",
  "this.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.21 ",
  "3.  Sen Gupta is selfish and is a careerist. He is trying to get attention of Government unmindful ",
  "of suffering of his spouse. ",
  "4.  Poornima\u2019s disappointment is understandable. However, she is taking a somewhat myopic ",
  "view of life. In this type of career, such inconvenience and loss of community contact is very ",
  "common. She needs to accept that gracefully. ",
  " ",
  "Discussion ",
  "Answer choice (1) looks at things from Poornima\u2019s perspective.It argues that as Governments are ",
  "generally slow to appreciate an officer\u2019s commitment and contribution, there is no point in Sen ",
  "Gupta making such a choice. He will be better off, if he does not volunteer. ",
  "This view of human motivation is superficial at best. Career choices cannot mirror commercial ",
  "transaction. Sometimes officers make choices that reflect their world view and their sense of purpose ",
  "in life. Don\u2019t we know that there are many eminent individuals who left civil services and took ",
  "different paths to serve the community? Some of them acquired name and fame after long years ",
  "of effort. The concept of self-actualisation captures such motivation well. Sen Gupta possibly has a ",
  "genuine desire to serve the poor tribal community with full knowledge that his contribution may not ",
  "earn any special recognition. Thus answer choice (1) does not express an objective view of human ",
  "motivation and hence it is incorrect. ",
  "(2) This action of Sen Gupta suggests that he at least for some time wants to serve in tribal area. ",
  "Those areas may not offer urban facilities and social interaction with elites in the ordinary sense we ",
  "understand the term. However, they offer rich potential to do good for a section of disadvantaged ",
  "Indians. No doubt, it is a worthy cause that Sen Gupta has espoused. An element of idealism in his ",
  "personality may be inferred from this choice. It is also true that Poornima should have known him ",
  "better and should have been prepared to live for some time in tribal area. Thus, this statement is ",
  "correct. ",
  "(3) There is no substance in the argument that Sen Gupta is trying to capture Government\u2019s ",
  "attention by making this choice. Government memory is known to be too short to register such ",
  "quality of an individual officer. For Government it is a routine. If nobody indicated preference they ",
  "would select some officer in their best judgement and post him in that place. Hence this statement ",
  "is incorrect. ",
  "(4) It is true that Poornima has to have a holistic appreciation of facts and their family life. ",
  "Government servants do not stay long in one place except when they become senior and gravitate ",
  "towards state and/or national capital. Anyway, she should have realised that stay in Vishakhapatnam ",
  "cannot be for too long. While transferring government officers, Governments seldom take their ",
  "preferences into account. That is the way it works, and officers know this as soon as they join civil ",
  "services. ",
  "She is a bit myopic too. As an educated person she would have known that tribal areas offer ",
  "different kinds of avenues for culture related pursuits. With time and open mind she would perhaps ",
  "discover one or two such avenues and then put her drive and energy into them. She should not ",
  "allow disappointment to weigh heavily on her mind. Hence this statement is also correct.  ",
  "23.22   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "Empathy ",
  "This brings us to empathy which is a most important aspect of emotional intelligence. It is the ",
  "quality which enables government servants to address the problems of the poor, deprived and the ",
  "vulnerable sections of the population. It lies at the root of human altruism and concern for others. ",
  "Its total absence leads to criminal psychopathic behaviour as in killers, rapists and child molesters. ",
  "Self-awareness opens the gates to empathy. If one cannot gauge one\u2019s emotions, he will hardly ",
  "know how others feel. The inability to observe the feelings of others is a notable failing of emotional ",
  "intelligence. It means that one misses out on what it is to be human. For building rapport with others ",
  "and concern for fellow human beings arise from attuning oneself to the emotions of others or from ",
  "capacity for empathy. Empathy or the ability to read the emotions of others is critical for many ",
  "tasks \u2013 whether it is parenting, teaching, negotiating or explaining government policy to villagers. ",
  "Deep attentive interest in fellow human beings is a mark of empathy. This does not mean ",
  "unwholesome curiosity about the personal life of others or maliciously gossiping about them. At the ",
  "same time, we should not be indifferent to others or ignore their existences and well being. But it ",
  "means that we should observe them and guess at their moods and feelings. Emotional states of people ",
  "are usually revealed through bodily clues, facial expressions and general movements, gestures and ",
  "postures. By paying attention to these, we can interact with them better in various situations. The ",
  "purpose is not take advantage of their emotionally vulnerable states but to help them better. ",
  "Empathy is the basis of considerate behaviour towards others. A famous line of John Donne ",
  "runs: \u201cNever send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\u201d In simple terms, it means that we ",
  "should consider the troubles of others as our own. Empathy is feeling one with another; its opposite ",
  "is antipathy. This feeling and concern for others frequently crops up in ethical dilemmas. Should X ",
  "share the difficult office situation with his pregnant wife or spare her the anxiety? ",
  "In empathy we are moved by the pain of others. When a bystander meets with an accident, we ",
  "rush to his aid. Empathy also leads to higher principles of conduct and justice. In this situation, we ",
  "put ourselves in the place of the other and view things from his perspective. The idea of punishment ",
  "for a crime originates in this manner. We feel one with the victim and feel from his point of view ",
  "that his pain should be assuaged at least partly through the punishment meted out to the criminal. ",
  "Empathy is a first step in cultivating social skills needed in an organization. Empathy enables us to ",
  "observe the feelings and perspectives of others and actively follow their interests. In this process, we ",
  "understand others. This makes us recognise their needs and offer them help. In a business context, ",
  "this translates to anticipating, recognizing and meeting customer needs. As we noted earlier, this ",
  "service orientation will be of great use in social and economic development programmes focused ",
  "on the poor and the weak. ",
  "Managers have to attend to and foster the development needs of those working with them. ",
  "Empathy is essential for performing this task. One part of this task is to recognise the good performance ",
  "of subordinates and reward them suitably. Second is to see their likely career growth path in the ",
  "organization and help them along the way. Finally, subordinates have to be supported with advice, ",
  "feedback and through assignment of challenging tasks.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.23 ",
  "Though it may seem surprising, empathy helps managers to follow the political dynamics within ",
  "an organization. The politics within an organization are not part of national politics. It refers to the ",
  "way senior managers combine forces to exert influence in organizational decision making. It may ",
  "also mean recognition of the prominent social networks in the organization and the manner in ",
  "which they operate. This awareness will also promote understanding of the forces that shape the ",
  "views and actions of clients, customers and competitors. It will also help in accurately reading the ",
  "actual situations within and outside the organization. These insights are important in devising and ",
  "implementing corporate policies and programmes. ",
  "Conclusion ",
  "In one sense, the components of emotional intelligence we discussed can be called character. It is ",
  "a term which moral philosophers used since ancient times. One writer described character as the ",
  "psychological muscle needed for moral conduct. We conclude with the following passage from Daniel ",
  "Goleman which can serve as a summation of this chapter. \u201cThe bedrock of character is self discipline; the ",
  "virtuous life, as philosophers since Aristotle have observed, is based on self control. A related key-stone of character is ",
  "being able to motivate and guide oneself, whether in doing homework, finishing a job, or getting up in the morning. And, ",
  "as we have seen, the ability to defer gratification and control and channel one\u2019s urges to act is a basic emotional skill, ",
  "one that in a former day was called will. ... Being able to put away one\u2019s self-centered focus and impulses has social ",
  "benefits. It opens the way to empathy, to real listening, to taking another person\u2019s perspective. Empathy, as we have seen, ",
  "leads to caring, altruism, and compassion.\u201d ",
  " ",
  "CASE 11 ",
  "Rohini is the marketing chief of a globally reputed multinational corporation. This evening the ",
  "Board of the corporation decided that she is to be appointed as the Chief Executive and President ",
  "of the Board of the corporation for a term of three years. Obviously, she was overjoyed with the ",
  "recognition and honour bestowed upon her \u2013 though she had migrated to USA only 18 years ago. ",
  "After exchanging pleasantries with all the senior colleagues who had come to greet her in her chamber, ",
  "she was late reaching home. When she just parked the car in her garage, on the spacious balcony, ",
  "she saw her well-educated mom Malathi waiting for her. Seeing her, Rohini spoke in a cheerful ",
  "tone \u201cMom, today I have great news to share with you.\u201d Malathi\u2019s response was instantaneous, ",
  "\u201cRohini, there is no milk in the house. At least for tomorrow, why don\u2019t you go and pick up some ",
  "packets rightaway?\u201d ",
  "Rohini was a bit surprised because her husband Ashwath should have reached home much ",
  "earlier. When she asked what prevented Ashwath from doing this as she was already late, Malathi ",
  "coldly told that Ashwath is tired this evening and resting. ",
  "Rohini was already at a high position in corporate ladder in USA and they were staying in ",
  "an exclusive area. So she had to go to the nearby town to pick up milk and she took another 45 ",
  "minutes to come home. Once in home she shared the good news with Malathi. Malathi however, ",
  "in a sober tone told her that a woman has to look after husband, children and parents and that that ",
  "is inevitable. So, Rohini would do well to leave her \u2018crown\u2019 in office and remain the good daughter ",
  "she is.  ",
  "23.24   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "Question ",
  "Review each of the following statements from the standpoint of emotional intelligence and state with ",
  "reasons whether you agree with the statement or not. There may be more than one valid statement. ",
  "1.  Rohini did not expect this treatment from her mom. Before asking her to get milk right way ",
  "Malathi should have at least shown curiosity about the good news that Rohini hinted at. ",
  "2.  Malathi is right. An individual owes his/ her first duty to family members. ",
  "3.  Malathi has shown poor emotional competence. Even after knowing the good news instead ",
  "of complimenting Rohini, she preferred to give a lecture like a wise person. ",
  "4.  With too little expression of positive emotions and obsessive focus on performance and ",
  "duty, Indian parenting acquires a robotic quality. Malathi is a victim of that type of culture. ",
  "Discussion ",
  "The statement (1) is definitely valid. Rohini was late from office, and she had mentioned that she had ",
  "good news to share. Any sensible family member at that time would want to know what the good ",
  "news is. That is applied emotional intelligence \u2013 plain and simple. Procuring milk is not such a big ",
  "issue. It would have been understandable if somebody had fallen seriously ill and shifting him/her ",
  "to hospital was required. Then that activity would have overriding preference and sharing of good ",
  "news could wait. That was not the situation. ",
  "The second statement has got the first part wrong. Yes, there is a primary duty to family members, ",
  "but that duty must be a sensible call. Trivia like buying milk cannot be elevated to the level of duty ",
  "to keep in abeyance the joy of life and make it mechanical. ",
  "The third statement is correct. After hearing the news the educated lady that Malathi is, she should ",
  "have appreciated the implication. It is no ordinary achievement for a woman executive to break the ",
  "glass ceilings in American society. The achievement is especially remarkable because the executive ",
  "is an immigrant and carries an unspoken burden of being non-native. Once that appreciation is ",
  "in place she should have felt proud that her daughter has accomplished this feat and should have ",
  "profusely congratulated her. There was no need to talk about duties \u2013 much less about the office ",
  "\u2018crown\u2019. That sarcasm was completely out of place. ",
  "There is substance in the fourth statement. Emphasis on performance and duty is fine. At the ",
  "same time positive emotions \u2013 support, friendliness, empathy and sharing of joy in achievement \u2013 ",
  "are equally important. The scale should be balanced in the middle and be not tilted on either side. ",
  "Indian parenting may indeed have a bias and this bias might have found expression in the behaviour ",
  "of Malathi. ",
  " ",
  "   Summary  ",
  " ",
  "\u00a4  The expression \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019 may seem a contradiction in terms. ",
  "\u00a4  Philosophers saw a sharp dichotomy between the two sides \u2013 emotional and intellectual\u2013of ",
  "human mental life. ",
  "\u00a4  The skill sets which public servants require fall into three distinct, though not watertight, ",
  "categories.  ",
  "Emotional Intelligence   23.25 ",
  "\u00a4 These are intellectual abilities (comprising mathematical and verbal skills), moral qualities ",
  "and emotional intelligence. ",
  "\u00a4 The term IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a score on a test that measures an individual\u2019s ",
  "cognitive ability in comparison to the general population. ",
  "\u00a4  IQ tests are designed to measure general ability to solve problems and understand concepts. ",
  "\u00a4 These in turn include - reasoning ability, problem-solving ability, and ability to perceive ",
  "relationships between things and ability to store and retrieve information. ",
  "\u00a4 For over hundred years, intelligence meant only the scores of intelligence tests. They were ",
  "considered adequate measures of human intelligence. ",
  "\u00a4 Intelligence meaning cognitive skills as shown by IQ was considered an innate, unalterable ",
  "natural endowment. ",
  "\u00a4 Howard Gardener questioned the conventional method of measuring intelligence as a single, ",
  "one-dimensional skill and as the only golden key to success in life. ",
  "\u00a4 Howard Gardener identified seven varieties of intelligence including the usually recognised ",
  "intellectual  skills. ",
  "\u00a4 These skills are - mathematical/logical, linguistic, spatial visualization, kinaesthetic genius, ",
  "musical, inter-personal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence. ",
  "\u00a4 Emotional intelligence refers mainly to\u2019personal intelligence\u2019 that help in getting along well ",
  "with people and in prudently ordering one\u2019s life. ",
  "\u00a4 Two psychologists, Peter Salovey and John Mayer, proposed a comprehensive theory of ",
  "emotional intelligence in 1990. ",
  "\u00a4 Daniel Goleman conceptualized emotional intelligence on the basis of five main aspects: ",
  "self-awareness; self-regulation; motivation; empathy; and social skills. ",
  "\u00a4 In recent years, emotional intelligence has become an important topic in management ",
  "studies. Its emergence marks a major shift in thinking. It arose from radical changes in the ",
  "operating environment of businesses. ",
  "\u00a4 The twin forces of globalization and information technology radically transformed the ",
  "operating environment of businesses. This transformation also altered the emotional ",
  "environment within organizations. ",
  "\u00a4  Managers can no longer produce results by dominating or ordering subordinates around. ",
  "They have to be virtuosos in interpersonal skills. ",
  "\u00a4 In any organization, work is done cooperatively in teams. Nowadays, the teams are made ",
  "up of knowledge workers with specialized skills. In these situations, managers have to rely ",
  "on social skills. ",
  "\u00a4  Critical review of work is a common activity in any organization. ",
  "\u00a4 But managerial behaviour in supervising subordinates\u2019 work is marked by common ",
  "dysfunctionalities. ",
  "\u00a4 Harry Levinson mentions that the work done by subordinates should be criticised ",
  "constructively based on the factors of specificity, providing solutions, face to face contact ",
  "and empathy.  ",
  "23.26   Ethics, Integrity & Aptitude ",
  "\u00a4 In knowledge based work, team replaces the individual as the work unit. As a result, emotional ",
  "intelligence, which comprises skills that promote harmonious group-working has become ",
  "important. ",
  "\u00a4 The following skills are vital in such organizations: influence, communication, conflict ",
  "management, leadership and acting as catalysts for change. ",
  "\u00a4  We have given the gist of these skills in the narration. Students can refer to it. ",
  "\u00a4 Government servants need to show personal commitment in implementing welfare ",
  "programmes for the deprived groups. ",
  "\u00a4 Empathy is a fundamental aspect of emotional intelligence. It is the quality which enables ",
  "government servants to address the problems of the poor, deprived and the vulnerable ",
  "sections of the population. ",
  "\u00a4 Empathy or the ability to read the emotions of others is critical for many tasks \u2013 whether it ",
  "is parenting, teaching, negotiating or explaining government policy to villagers. ",
  "\u00a4  Empathy is the basis of other-regarding behaviour. ",
  "\u00a4  Empathy is a first step in cultivating social skills needed in an organization. ",
