  "The consumers which start the food chain, utilising the ",

  "plant or plant part as their food, constitute the grazing ",
  "food chain. This food chain begins from green plants at ",
  "2.3. FOOD WEB",
  "the base and the primary consumer is herbivore.",
  "A food chain represents only one part of the food or energy ",
  "flow through an ecosystem and implies a simple, isolated ",
  "relationship, which seldom occurs in the ecosystems. ",
  "An ecosystem may consist of several interrelated food ",
  "chains. More typically, the same food resource is part of ",
  "more than one chain, especially when that resource is at ",
  "the lower trophic levels. ",
  "\u201cA food web illustrates, all possible transfers of energy and ",
  "nutrients among the organisms in an ecosystem, whereas ",
  "a food chain traces only one pathway of the food\u201d.",
  "Grazing Food Chain",
  "For example, In terestrial ecosystem, grass is eaten up by ",
  "caterpillar, which is eaten by lizard and lizard is eaten by ",

  "Also food availability and preferences of food of the organ-",
  "isms may shift seasonally e.g. we eat watermelon in sum-",
  "mer  and  peaches  in  the  winter.  Thus  there  are ",
  "interconnected networks of feeding relationships that take ",
  "the form of food webs.",
  "Do you know?",
  "Dolphins, Porpoises and whales are called cetaceans. ",
  "A cetacean is a creature belonging to a group of water ",
  "living mammals that have no hind limbs and a blow-",

  "2.4. ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS \u2022  The grasses occupy the lowest trophic level (base) be-",
  "cause of their abundance. ",
  "The steps of trophic levels expressed in a diagrammatic ",
  "\u2022  The next higher trophic level is primary consumer - ",

  "The ecological pyramids are of three categories. ",
  "(b) Pyramid of numbers - inverted",
  "1.  Pyramid of numbers, ",
  "2.  Pyramid of biomass, and ",
  "3.  Pyramid of energy or productivity. ",
  "2\ufffd4\ufffd1\ufffd Pyramid of Numbers ",
  "This deals with the relationship between the numbers of ",
  "primary producers and consumers of different levels. It is ",
  "a graphic representation of the total number of individuals ",
  "of different species, belonging to each trophic level in an ",
  "ecosystem.",
  "Depending upon the size and biomass, the pyramid of ",
  "numbers may not always be upright, and may even be ",
  "completely inverted.",
  "(a) Pyramid of numbers - upright",
  "\u2022  In this pyramid, the number of individuals is decreased ",
  "from lower level to higher trophic level. ",

  "the size of organisms being counted in each trophic level ",
  "can vary. ",
  "\u2022  It is very difficult to count all the organisms, in a pyra-",
  "mid of numbers and so the pyramid of number does not ",
  "completely define the trophic structure for an ecosystem.",
  "2\ufffd4\ufffd2\ufffd Pyramid of Biomass ",
  "In order to overcome the shortcomings of pyramid of num-",
  "bers, the pyramid of biomass is used. In this approach ",
  "individuals in each trophic level are weighed instead of ",
  "being counted. This gives us a pyramid of biomass, i.e., the ",
  "total dry weight of all organisms at each trophic level at a ",
  "particular time. ",
  "Pyramid of biomass is usually determined by collecting all ",
  "organisms occupying each trophic level separately and ",
  "measuring their dry weight. This overcomes the size dif-",
  "ference problem because all kinds of organisms at a trophic ",
  "level are weighed. Biomass is measured in g/m2.  This is because the producers are tiny phytoplanktons that ",
  "grow and reproduce rapidly. Here, the pyramid of biomass ",
  "(a) Upward pyramid",
  "has a small base, with the consumer biomass at any instant ",
  "actually exceeding the producer biomass and the pyramid ",
  "assumes inverted shape. ",
  "2\ufffd4\ufffd3\ufffd Pyramid of Energy",
  "To compare the functional roles of the trophic levels in an ",
  "ecosystem, an energy pyramid is most suitable. An energy ",
  "pyramid, reflects the laws of thermodynamics, with con-",
  "version of solar energy to chemical energy and heat energy ",
  "at each trophic level and with loss of energy being depicted ",
  "at each transfer to another trophic level. Hence the pyra-",
  "mid is always upward, with a large energy base at the ",
  "bottom. ",
  "Let us explain this with an example. Suppose an ecosys-",
  "tem receives 1000 calories of light energy in a given day. ",
  "Most of the energy is not absorbed; some is reflected back ",
  "Upright Pyramid of Biomass",
  "to space; of the energy absorbed only a small portion is ",

  "collects scents and small organisms from whatever it touches and from the air around it. When the tongue goes back ",
  "into the mouth the forks touch a special sensory spot called the Jacobson\u2019s organ on the roof of the mouth and tells ",

  "high enough dosages to cause problems. ",
  "Movement of these pollutants involves two main processes: ",
  "i)   Bioaccumulation ",
  "ii)  Biomagnification.",
  "2\ufffd5\ufffd1\ufffd Bioaccumulation ",
  "\u2022  It refers to how pollutants enter a food chain.",
  "\u2022  In bioaccumulation there is an increase in concentration ",
  "of a pollutant from the environment to the first organ-",
  "ism in a food chain.",

  "Now suppose an animal, say a deer, eats the plant contain-",
  "ing 100 cal of food energy. The deer uses some of it for its ",
  "own metabolism and stores only 10 cal as food energy. A ",
  "lion that eats the deer gets an even smaller amount of ",
  "energy. Thus usable energy decreases from sunlight to ",
  "producer to herbivore to carnivore. Therefore, the energy ",
  "pyramid will always be upright. ",
  "Energy pyramid concept helps to explain the phenomenon ",
  "of biological magnification-the tendency for toxic sub-",
  "stances to increase in concentration progressively at higher ",
  "levels of the food chain. ",
  "2.5 POLLUTANTS AND TROPHIC LEVEL",
  "Pollutants especially nondegradable ones move through the ",
