  "Just as greenhouses, that keeps the air warm inside its ",

  "15\u00b0C and the earth would be a frozen lifeless planet. ",
  "The greenhouse effect is a process (similar to green house) ",
  "caused by greenhouse gases, which occur naturally in the ",
  "atmosphere. This process plays a crucial role in warming ",
  "the Earth\u2019s surface, making it habitable.",
  "However, human-generated greenhouse gas emissions ",
