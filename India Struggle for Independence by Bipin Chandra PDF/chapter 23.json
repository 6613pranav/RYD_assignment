  "CHAPTER 23. FROM KARACHI TO  ",
  "                      WARDHA: THE YEARS     ",
  "                      FROM 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "The Congress met at Karachi on 29 March 1931 to endorse ",
  "the  Gandhi-Irwin  or  Delhi  Pact.  Bhagat  Singh,  Sukhdev  and ",
  "Rajguru  had  been  executed  six  days  earlier.  Even  though ",
  "Gandhiji had made every attempt to save their lives, there was ",
  "anger among the people, especially the youth, as to why he had ",
  "not refused to sign the Pact on this question. All along Gandhiji\u2019s ",
  "route to Karachi he was greeted with black flag demonstrations. ",
  "The Congress passed a resolution drafted by Gandhiji by which ",
  "it,  \u2018while  dissociating  itself  from  and  disapproving  of  political ",
  "violence in any shape or form,\u2019 admired \u2018the bravery and sacrifice\u2019 ",
  "of the three martyrs.\u2019 The Congress endorsed the Delhi Pact and ",
  "reiterated the goal of Poorna Swaraj.  ",
  "The Karachi session became memorable for its resolution on ",
  "Fundamental  Rights  and  the  National  Economic  Programme. ",
  "Even though the Congress had from its inception fought for the ",
  "economic  interests,  civil  liberties  and  political  rights  of  the ",
  "people, this was the first  time  that the  Congress defined  what ",
  "Swaraj  would  mean  for  the  masses.  It  also  declared  that,  \u2018in ",
  "order  to  end  the  exploitation  of  the  masses,  political  freedom ",
  "must include real economic freedom of the starving millions.\u2019 The ",
  "resolution guaranteed the basic civil rights of free speech, free ",
  "press, free assembly, and freedom of association; equality before ",
  "the law irrespective of caste, creed or sex; neutrality of the state ",
  "in regard to all religions; elections on the basis of universal adult ",
  "franchise;  and  free  and  compulsory  primary  education.  It ",
  "promised substantial reduction in rent and revenue, exemption ",
  "from  rent  in  case  of  uneconomic  holdings,  and  relief  of ",
  "agricultural indebtedness and control of usury; better conditions ",
  "for workers including a living wage, limited hours of work and ",
  "protection  of  women  workers;  the  right  to  organize  and  form ",
  "unions to workers and peasants; and state ownership or control ",
  "of  key  industries,  mines  and  means  of  transport.  It  also ",
  " 278 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "maintained  that  \u2018the  culture,  language  and  script  of  the ",
  "minorities and of the different linguistic areas shall be protected.\u2019 ",
  "The  Karachi  resolution  was  to  remain  in  essence  the  basic ",
  "political and economic programme of the Congress in later years.  ",
  " ",
  "* ",
  "Gandhiji sailed for London on 29 August 1931 to attend the ",
  "Second  Round  Table  Conference.  Nothing  much  was  expected ",
  "from  the  Conference  for  the  imperialist  political  and  financial ",
  "forces,  which  ultimately  controlled  the  British  Government  in ",
  "London, were opposed to any political or economic concessions ",
  "being given to India which could lead to its independence from ",
  "their control. Winston Churchill, leader of the virulent right-wing, ",
  "had strongly objected to the British Government negotiating on ",
  "terms of equality with the \u2018seditious fakir\u2019 and demanded strong ",
  "government in India. The Conservative Daily Mail declared that ",
  "\u2018Without India, the British Commonwealth would fall to pieces. ",
  "Commercially,  economically,  politically  and  geographically  it  is ",
  "our greatest imperial asset. To imperil our hold on it would be the ",
  "worst  treason  any  Briton  could  commit.\u2019  In  India,  Irwin  was ",
  "replaced by Willingdon as the Viceroy. In Britain, after December ",
  "1931, the Laborite Ramsay  MacDonald headed a Conservative-",
  "dominated Cabinet with the weak and reactionary Samuel Hoare ",
  "as  the  Secretary  of  State  for  India.  Apart  from  a  few  able ",
  "individuals, the overwhelming majority of Indian delegates to the ",
  "Round Table Conference (RTC), hand-picked by the Government, ",
  "were loyalists, communalists, careerists, and place-hunters, big ",
  "landlords and representatives of the princes. They were used by ",
  "the Government to claim that the Congress did not represent the ",
  "interests  of  all  Indians  vis-a-vis  imperialism,  and  to  neutralize ",
  "Gandhiji and all his efforts to confront the imperialist rulers with ",
  "the basic question of freedom.  ",
  "The great Gujarati poet, Meghani, in a famous poem gave ",
  "expression  to  the  nationalist  misgivings  regarding  the  RTC. ",
  "Addressing Gandhiji on the eve of his departure for London, he ",
  "sang in the first line: \u2018Chchello Katoro Jerno Aa: Pi Jayo Bapu!\u2019 ",
  "(Even this last cup of poison, you must drink, Bapu!) Gandhiji ",
  "himself said: \u2018When I think of the prospects in London, when I 279 | From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "know that all is not well in India . . . there is nothing wanting to ",
  "fill  me  with  utter  despair.  .  .  There  is  every  chance  of  my ",
  "returning  empty-handed\u2019.  That  is  exactly  what  happened  in ",
  "London.  The  British  Government  refused  to  concede  the  basic ",
  "Indian demand for freedom. Gandhiji came back at the end of ",
  "December 1931 to a changed political situation.  ",
  "The  higher  British  officials  in  India  had  drawn  their  own ",
  "lessons  from  the  political  impact  of  the  Delhi  Pact  which  had ",
  "raised  the  political  prestige  of  the  Congress  and  the  political ",
  "morale  of  the  people  and  undermined  and  lowered  British ",
  "prestige.  They,  as  well  as  the  new  Viceroy,  believed  that  the ",
  "Government had made a major error in negotiating and signing a ",
  "truce with the Congress, as if between two equal powers. They ",
  "were  now  determined  to  reverse  it  all.  No  pact,  no  truce,  no ",
  "Gandhi-Viceroy meetings, no \u2018quarter for the enemy\u2019 became the ",
  "watchwords of Government policy.  ",
  "The  British  policy  was  now  dominated  by  three  major ",
  "considerations: (a) Gandhiji must not be permitted to build up ",
  "the tempo for a massive and protracted mass movement, as he ",
  "had  done  in  1919,  1920-1  and  1930.  (b)  The  Government ",
  "functionaries \u2014 village officials, police and higher bureaucrats \u2014 ",
  "and the loyalists \u2014 \u2018our friends\u2019 \u2014 must not feel disheartened ",
  "that Gandhiji was being \u2018resurrected as a rival authority to the ",
  "Government of India,\u2019 and that the Government was losing the ",
  "will to rule. As the Home Member, H.G. Haig, put it: \u2018We can, in ",
  "my view, do without the goodwill of the Congress, and in fact I do ",
  "not  believe  for  a  moment  that  we  shall  ever  have  it,  but  we ",
  "cannot  afford  to  do  without  the  confidence  of  those  who  have ",
  "supported  us  in the long struggle against the Congress.\u2019 (c) In ",
  "particular,  the  nationalist  movement  must  not  be  permitted  to ",
  "gather force and consolidate itself in rural areas, as it was doing ",
  "all over India, especially in U.P., Gujarat, Andhra, Bihar, Bengal ",
  "and NWFP.  ",
  "While  Gandhiji  was  in  London,  the  Government  of  India ",
  "prepared,  in  secret,  plain  for  the  coming  showdown  with  the ",
  "nationalist  forces.  It  decided  to  launch  \u2018a  hard  and  immediate ",
  "blow\u2019 against any revival of the movement and to arrest Gandhiji ",
  "at the very outset. It drafted a series of ordinances which would ",
  "usher in virtual martial law, though under civilian control.  ",
  " 280 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "The  shape  of  things  to  come  had  been  overshadowed  by ",
  "what  happened  in  U.P.,  NWFP  and  Bengal  during  the  truce ",
  "period,  hi  U.P.  the  Congress  was  leading  a  campaign  for ",
  "reduction of rent, remission of arrears of rent and prevention of ",
  "eviction of tenants for non-payment of rents. By the first week of ",
  "December,  the  Congress  had  launched  a  no-rent,  no-revenue ",
  "campaign  in  five  districts.  The  Government\u2019s  response  was  to ",
  "arrest Jawaharlal on 26 December when he was going to Bombay ",
  "to  meet  Gandhiji.  In  the  North-Western  Frontier  Province,  the ",
  "Government  continued  its  severe  repression  against  the  non-",
  "violent Khudai Khidmatgars (servants of God), also known as Red ",
  "Shirts because of the colour of their shirts, and the peasants they ",
  "led  against  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  extracting  revenue ",
  "through  cruel  methods  and  torture.  On  24  December,  their ",
  "leader, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, was arrested and Peshawar district ",
  "was occupied by the army. In Bengal, the Government was ruling ",
  "through  draconian  ordinances  and  detaining  thousands  of ",
  "political workers in the name of fighting terrorism. In September, ",
  "the police fired upon political prisoners in Hijli jail, killing two.  ",
  "Gandhiji landed in Bombay on 28 December. The Congress ",
  "Working Committee met the next day and decided to resume civil ",
  "disobedience.  On  the  31st,  Gandhiji  asked  the  Viceroy  for  a ",
  "meeting, offering to suspend the decision on civil disobedience till ",
  "such a meeting. The Viceroy refused to see Gandhiji \u2014 the first of ",
  "many  such  refusals  during  the  next  five  years.  On  4  January ",
  "1932,  the  Government  launched  its  pre-emptive  strike  against ",
  "the  national  movement  by  arresting  Gandhiji,  promulgating ",
  "ordinances which gave the authorities unlimited power \u2014 thus ",
  "initiating what a historian has described as \u2018Civil Martial Law.\u2019 ",
  "Civil liberties  no longer existed and the authorities could seize ",
  "people and property at will. Within a week, leading Congressmen ",
  "all over the country were behind bars.  ",
  "The Indian people responded with anger. Even though the ",
  "Congress  entered  the  battle  rather  unprepared,  the  popular ",
  "response  was  massive.  In  the  first  four  months,  over  80,000 ",
  "Satyagrahis,  most  of  them  urban  and  rural  poor,  were  jailed, ",
  "while  lakhs  took  to  the  picketing  of  shops  selling  liquor  and ",
  "foreign  cloth.  Illegal  gatherings,  non-violent  demonstrations, ",
  "celebrations of various national days, and other forms of defiance ",
  "of the ordinances were the rule of the day.  281 | From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "The non-violent movement was met by relentless repression. ",
  "The  Congress  and  its  allied  organizations  were  declared  illegal ",
  "and their offices and funds seized. Nearly all the Gandhi Ashrams ",
  "were occupied by the police. Peaceful picketers, Satyagrahis and ",
  "processionists  were  lathi-charged,  beaten  and  often  awarded ",
  "rigorous imprisonment and heavy fines, which were realized by ",
  "selling their lands and property at throw away prices. Prisoners ",
  "in  jail  were  barbarously  treated.  Whipping  as  punishment ",
  "became frequent. The no-tax campaigns in different parts of rural ",
  "India  were  treated  with  great  severity.  Lands,  houses,  cattle, ",
  "agricultural  implements,  and  other  property  were  freely ",
  "confiscated. The police indulged in naked terror and committed ",
  "innumerable atrocities. At Ras, a village in Gujarat, the non-tax ",
  "paying peasants were stripped naked, publicly whipped and given ",
  "electric shocks. The wrath of the Government fell with particular ",
  "harshness  on  women.  Conditions  in  jails  were  made ",
  "extraordinarily severe with the idea of scaring away women from ",
  "the Satyagraha. The freedom of the Press to report or comment ",
  "on the movement, or even to print pictures of national leaders or ",
  "Satyagrahis, was curtailed. Within the first six months of 1932 ",
  "action  was  taken  against  109  journalists  and  ninety-eight ",
  "printing  presses.  Nationalist  literature  \u2014  poems,  stories  and ",
  "novels \u2014 was banned on a large scale.  ",
  "The people fought back. But Gandhiji and other leaders had ",
  "no. time to build up the tempo of the movement and it could not ",
  "be  sustained  for  long.  The  movement  was  effectively  crushed ",
  "within  a  few  months.  In  August  1932,  the  number  of  those ",
  "convicted came down to 3,047 and by August 1933 only 4,500 ",
  "Satyagrahis  were  in  jail.  However,  the  movement  continued  to ",
  "linger  till  early  April  1934  when  the  inevitable  decision  to ",
  "withdraw it was taken by Gandhiji.  ",
  "Political activists despaired at the turn the movement had ",
  "taken. What have we achieved, many asked? Even a buoyant and ",
  "active person like Jawaharlal gave voice to this sense of despair ",
  "\u2014 accentuated by his separation from his sick wife \u2014 by copying ",
  "a verse in  his jail diary  in June  1935: \u2018Sad  winds  where your ",
  "voice was; Tears, tears where my heart was; and ever with me, ",
  "Child,  ever  with  me,  Silence  where  hope  was.\u20197  Earlier,  when ",
  "Gandhiji had withdrawn the movement, Jawaharlal had felt \u2018with ",
  "a stab of pain\u2019 that his long association with Gandhiji was about ",
  " 282 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "to come to an end. Subhas Chandra Bose and Vithalbhai Patel ",
  "had been much more critical of Gandhiji\u2019s leadership. In a strong ",
  "statement from Europe they had said in 1933 that \u2018Mr. Gandhi ",
  "as  a  political  leader  has  failed\u2019  and  called  for  \u2018a  radical ",
  "reorganization  of  the  Congress  on  a  new  principle  with  a  new ",
  "method, for which a new leader is essential.\u2019 ",
  "The  enemies  of  Indian  nationalism  gloated  over  the ",
  "frustration  among  the  nationalists  \u2014  and  grossly  misread  it. ",
  "Willingdon declared in early 1933: \u2018The Congress is in a definitely ",
  "less favourable position than in 1930, and has lost its hold on ",
  "the public.\u201d But Willingdon and company had completely failed to ",
  "understand  the  nature  and  strategy  of  the  Indian  national ",
  "movement \u2014 it was basically a struggle for the minds of men and ",
  "women. Seen in this light, if the colonial policy of negotiations by ",
  "Irwin had failed earlier, so had the policy of ruthless suppression ",
  "by Willingdon. People had been cowed down by superior force; ",
  "they had not lost faith in the Congress. Though the movement ",
  "from 1930 to 1934 had not achieved independence and had been ",
  "temporarily  crushed,  the  Indian  people  had  been  further ",
  "transformed.  The  will  to  fight  had  been  further  strengthened; ",
  "faith  in  British  rule  had  been  completely  shattered.  H.N. ",
  "Brailsford, Laborite journalist, wrote, assessing the results of the ",
  "nationalists\u2019  most  recent  struggle,  that  the  Indians  \u2018had  freed ",
  "their own minds, they had won independence in their hearts.\u2019 ",
  "And, as we have seen earlier, this hiatus in the movement ",
  "too  was  primarily  to  rest  and  regroup.  Withdrawal  of  the ",
  "movement did not mean defeat or loss of mass support; it only ",
  "meant,  as  Dr.  Ansari  put  it,  \u2018having  fought  long  enough  we ",
  "prepare to rest,\u2019 to fight another day a bigger battle with greater ",
  "and better organized force.\u2019 Symbolic of the real outcome, the real ",
  "impact of the civil disobedience, was the heroes\u2019 welcome given to ",
  "prisoners on their release in 1934. And this became evident to all ",
  "when  the  Congress  captured  a  majority  in  six  out  of  eleven ",
  "provinces in the elections in 1937 despite the restricted nature of ",
  "the franchise.  ",
  "Alone among his contemporaries, Gandhiji understood the ",
  "true nature and outcome of the Civil Disobedience Movement. To ",
  "Nehru, he wrote in September 1933: \u2018I have no sense of defeat in ",
  "me and the hope in me that this country of ours is fast marching 283 | From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "towards  its  goal  is  burning  as  bright  as  it  did  in  1920.\u201d  He ",
  "reiterated this view to a group of Congress leaders in April 1934: ",
  "\u2018I feel no despondency in me. .. I am not feeling helpless. . . The ",
  "nation  has  got  energy  of  which  you  have  no  conception  but  I ",
  "have.\u201d He had, of course, an advantage over most other leaders. ",
  "While they needed a movement to sustain their sense of political ",
  "activism, he had always available the alternative of constructive ",
  "work.  ",
  "* ",
  "The  British  policy  of  \u2018Divide  and  Rule\u2019  found  another ",
  "expression  in  the  announcement  of  the  Communal  Award  in ",
  "August 1932. The Award allotted to each minority a number of ",
  "seats in the legislatures to be elected on the basis of a separate ",
  "electorate that is Muslims would be elected only by Muslims and ",
  "Sikhs only by Sikhs, and so on. Muslims, Sikhs and Christians ",
  "had already been treated as minorities. The Award declared the ",
  "Depressed  Classes  (Scheduled  Castes  of  today)  also  to  be  a ",
  "minority  community  entitled  to  separate  electorate  and  thus ",
  "separated them from the rest of the Hindus.  ",
  "The  Congress  was  opposed  to  a  separate  electorate  for ",
  "Muslims, Sikhs and \u2018Christians as it encouraged the communal ",
  "notion that they formed separate groups or communities having ",
  "interests  different  from  the  general  body  of  Indians.  The ",
  "inevitable result was to divide the Indian people and prevent the ",
  "growth of a common national consciousness. But the idea of a ",
  "separate  electorate  for  Muslims  had  been  accepted  by  the ",
  "Congress as far back as 1916 as a part of the compromise with ",
  "the Muslim League. Hence, the Congress took the position that ",
  "though  it  was  opposed  to  separate  electorates,  it  was  not  in ",
  "favour  of  changing  the  Award  without  the  consent  of  the ",
  "minorities.  Consequently,  though  strongly  disagreeing  with  the ",
  "Communal Award, it decided neither to accept it nor to reject it.  ",
  "But the effort to separate the Depressed Classes from the ",
  "rest of Hindus by treating them as separate political entities was ",
  "vehemently opposed by all the nationalists. Gandhiji, in Yeravada ",
  "jail at the time, in particular, reacted very strongly.\u2019 He saw the ",
  "Award as an attack on Indian unity and nationalism, harmful to ",
  " 284 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "both  Hinduism  and  the  Depressed  Classes,  for  it  provided  no ",
  "answers to the socially degraded position of the latter. Once the ",
  "Depressed  Classes  were  treated  as  a  separate  community,  the ",
  "question  of abolishing untouchability  would  not arise, and the ",
  "work of Hindu social reform in this respect would come to a halt.  ",
  "Gandhiji  argued  that  whatever  harm  separate  electorates ",
  "might do to Muslims or Sikhs, it did not affect the fact that they ",
  "would remain Muslims or Sikhs. But while reformers like himself ",
  "were working for the total eradication of untouchability, separate ",
  "electorates  would  ensure  that  \u2018untouchables  remain ",
  "untouchables  in  perpetuity.\u2019  What  was  needed  was  not  the ",
  "protection of the so-called interests of the Depressed Classes in ",
  "terms of seats in the legislatures or jobs but the \u2018root arid branch\u2019 ",
  "eradication of untouchability.  ",
  "Gandhiji  demanded  that  the  representatives  of  the ",
  "Depressed  Classes  should  be  elected  by  the  general  electorate ",
  "under  a  wide,  if  possible  universal,  common  franchise.  At  the ",
  "same time he did not object to the demand for a larger number of ",
  "the reserved seats for the Depressed Classes. He went on a fast ",
  "unto death on 20 September 1932 to enforce his demand. In a ",
  "statement  to  the  Press,  he  said:  \u2018My  life,  I  count  of  no ",
  "consequence.  One  hundred  lives  given  for  this  noble  cause ",
  "would, in my opinion, be poor penance done by Hindus for the ",
  "atrocious  wrongs  they  have  heaped  upon  helpless  men  and ",
  "women of their own faith.\u2019  ",
  "While  many  political  Indians  saw  the  fast  as  a  diversion ",
  "from the ongoing political movement, all were deeply concerned ",
  "and  emotionally  shaken.  Mass  meetings  took  place  almost ",
  "everywhere.  The  20th  of  September  was  observed  as  a  day  of ",
  "fasting and prayer. Temples, wells, etc., were thrown open to the ",
  "Depressed  Classes  all  over  the  country.  Rabindranath  Tagore ",
  "sent  a  telegraphic  message  to  Gandhiji:  \u2018It  is  worth  sacrificing ",
  "precious life for the sake of India\u2019s unity and her social integrity. . ",
  ".  Our  sorrowing  hearts  will  follow  your  sublime  penance  with ",
  "reverence  and  love.\u2019  Political  leaders  of  different  political ",
  "persuasions, including Madan Mohan Malaviya, M.C. Rajah and ",
  "B.R. Ambedkar, now became active. In the end they succeeded in ",
  "hammering  out  an  agreement,  known  as  the  Poona  Pact, ",
  "according  to  which  the  idea  of  separate  electorates  for  the 285 | From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "Depressed  Classes  was  abandoned  but  the  seats  reserved  for ",
  "them in the provincial legislatures were increased from seventy-",
  "one  in  the  Award  to  147  and  in  the  Central  Legislature  to ",
  "eighteen per cent of the total.  ",
  "* ",
  "Regarding  the  Poona  agreement,  Gandhiji  declared  after ",
  "breaking his fast: \u2018I would like to assure my Harijan friends . . . ",
  "that they may hold my life as a hostage for its due fulfilment.\u2019 He ",
  "now set out to redeem his pledge. First from jail and then from ",
  "outside, for nearly two years he gave up all other pre-occupations ",
  "and  earned  on  a  whirlwind  campaign  against  untouchability. ",
  "After  his  release  from  prison,  he  had  shifted  to  Satyagraha ",
  "Ashram  at  Wardha  after  abandoning  Sabarmati  Ashram  at ",
  "Ahmedabad for he had vowed in 1930 not to return to Sabarmati ",
  "till Swaraj was won. Starting from Wardha on 7 November 1933 ",
  "and until 29 July 1934, for nearly nine months, he conducted an ",
  "intensive  \u2018Harijan  tour\u2019  of  the  country  travelling  over  20,000 ",
  "kilometres  by  train,  car,  bullock  cart,  and  on  foot.  collecting ",
  "money  for  the  recently  founded  Harijan  Sewak  Sangh, ",
  "propagating  the  removal  of  untouchability  in  all  its  forms  and ",
  "practices, and urging social workers to leave all and go to  the ",
  "villages for the social, economic, cultural and political uplift of ",
  "the Harijans \u2014 his name for the Depressed Classes.  ",
  "In the course of his Harijan campaign, Gandhiji undertook ",
  "two major fasts on 8 May and 16 August 1933 to convince his ",
  "followers of the importance of the issue and the seriousness of ",
  "his effort. \u2018They must either remove untouchability or remove me ",
  "from their midst.\u2019 He justified these fasts as answers to his \u2018inner ",
  "voice,\u2019  which,  he  said,  could  also  be  described  as  \u2018dictates  of ",
  "reason.\u2019  These  fasts  created  consternation  in  the  ranks  of  the ",
  "nationalists, throwing many of them into an emotional crisis. The ",
  "fast of 8 May 1933 was opposed even by Kasturba, his wife. As ",
  "the hour of the fast approached, Miraben sent a telegram: \u2018Ba ",
  "wishes me to say she is greatly shocked. Feels the decision very ",
  "wrong but you have not listened to any others and so will not ",
  "hear her. She sends her heartfelt prayers.\u2019 Gandhiji\u2019s reply was ",
  "characteristic: \u2018Tell Ba her father imposed on her a companion ",
  " 286 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "whose weight would have killed any other woman. I treasure her ",
  "love. She must remain courageous to the end.\u2019  ",
  "Throughout Gandhiji\u2019s Harijan campaign, he was attacked ",
  "by orthodox and social reactionaries. They met him with black ",
  "flag  demonstrations  and  disrupted  his  meetings.  They  brought ",
  "out  scurrilous  and  inflammatory  leaflets  against  him,  putting ",
  "fantastic utterances in his mouth. They accused him of attacking ",
  "Hinduism. They publicly burnt his portraits. On 25 June 1934, ",
  "at Poona, a bomb was thrown on a car believed to be carrying ",
  "Gandhiji, injuring its seven occupants. The protesters offered the ",
  "Government  full  support  against  the  Congress  and  the  Civil ",
  "Disobedience  Movement  if  it  would  not  support  the  anti-",
  "untouchability campaign. The Government  obliged by defeating ",
  "the Temple Entry Bill in the Legislative Assembly in August 1934.  ",
  "Throughout  his  fast,  Harijan  work  and  Harijan  tour,  Gandhiji ",
  "stressed  on  certain  themes.  One  was  the  degree  of  oppression ",
  "practised on the Harijans; in fact, day after day he put forward a ",
  "damning indictment  of Hindu society: \u2018Socially they are lepers. ",
  "Economically  they  are  worse.  Religiously  they  are  denied ",
  "entrance to places we miscall houses of God. They are denied the ",
  "use,  on  the  same  terms  as  Hindus,  of  public  roads,  public ",
  "schools, public hospitals, public wells, public taps, public parks ",
  "and the like. . . They are relegated for their residence to the worst ",
  "quarters of cities and villages where they get no social services.\u2019 A ",
  "second  theme  was  that  of  the  \u2018root  and  branch  removal  of ",
  "untouchability.\u2019  Symbolic  or  rather  the  entering  wedge  in  this ",
  "respect was to be the throwing open of all temples to Harijans.  ",
  "Gandhiji\u2019s  entire  campaign  was  based  on  the  grounds  of ",
  "humanism and reason. But he also argued that untouchability, ",
  "as practised at present, had no sanction in the Hindu Shastras. ",
  "But even if this was not so, the Harijan worker should not feel ",
  "daunted.  Truth  could  -not  be  confined  within  the  covers  of  a ",
  "book.  The  Shastras  should  be  ignored  if  they  went  against ",
  "human dignity.  ",
  "A major running theme in Gandhiji\u2019s writings and speeches ",
  "was  the  need  for  caste  Hindus  to  do  \u2018penance\u2019  and  \u2018make ",
  "reparations  .  .  .  for  the  untold  hardships  to  which  we  have ",
  "subjected them (the Harijans) for centuries.\u2019 For this reason, he ",
  "was  not  hostile  to  Dr.  Ambedkar  and  other  Harijans  who 287 | From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "criticized and distrusted him. \u2018They have every right to distrust ",
  "me,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Do I not belong to the Hindu section miscalled ",
  "superior class or caste Hindus, who have ground down to powder ",
  "the  so  called  untouchables?\u2019  At  the  same  time,  he  repeatedly ",
  "warned  caste  Hindus  that  if  this  atonement  was  not  made, ",
  "Hinduism  would  perish:  \u2018Hinduism  dies  if  untouchability  lives, ",
  "and untouchability has to die if Hinduism is to live.\u2019 (This strong ",
  "theme of \u2018penance\u2019 largely explains why caste Hindus born and ",
  "brought  up  in  pre-1947  India  so  readily  accepted  large  scale ",
  "reservations in jobs, enrolment in professional colleges and so on ",
  "for  the  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  after ",
  "independence).  ",
  "Gandhiji  was  not in favour  of mixing  up  the issue  of the ",
  "removal  of  untouchability  with  the  issues  of  inter-dining  and ",
  "inter-marriage. Restriction on the latter should certainly go, for ",
  "\u2018dining and marriage restrictions stunt Hindu society.\u2019 But they ",
  "were also practised by caste Hindus among themselves as also ",
  "the Harijans among themselves. The present All-India campaign, ",
  "he said, had to be directed against the disabilities which  were ",
  "specific to the Harijans. Similarly, he distinguished between the ",
  "abolition of caste system and the abolition of untouchability. He ",
  "disagreed with Dr. Ambedkar when the latter asserted that \u2018the ",
  "outcaste  is  a  by-product  of  the  caste  system.  There  will  be ",
  "outcastes  as  long  as  there  are  castes.  And  nothing  can ",
  "emancipate  the  outcaste  except  the  destruction  of  the  caste ",
  "system.  On  the  contrary,  Gandhiji  said  that  whatever  the ",
  "\u2018limitations  and  defects\u2019  of  the  Vamashram,  \u2018there  is  nothing ",
  "sinful about it, as there is about untouchability.\u2019 He believed that ",
  "purged  of  untouchability,  itself  a  product  of  \u2018the  distinction  of ",
  "high  and  low\u2019  and  not  of  the  caste  system,  this  system  could ",
  "function  in  a  manner  that  would  make  each  caste ",
  "\u2018complementary of the other and none inferior or superior to any ",
  "other.\u2019 In any case, he said, both the believers and the critics of ",
  "the Varna system should join hands in fighting untouchability, ",
  "for opposition to the latter was common to both.  ",
  "Gandhiji also stressed the positive impact that the struggles ",
  "against untouchability would have on the communal and other ",
  "questions. Non- Hindus were treated by Hindus as untouchables ",
  "\u2018in  some  way  or  the  other,\u2019  especially  in  matters  of  food  and ",
  "drink, and non-Hindus certainly took note of this fact. Hence, \u2018if ",
  " 288 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "untouchability is removed, it must result in bringing all Indians ",
  "together.\u2019  Increasingly,  he  also  began  to  point  out  that ",
  "untouchability was only one form of the distinctions that society ",
  "made between man and man; it was a product of the grading of ",
  "society into high and low. To attack untouchability was to oppose ",
  "\u2018this  high-and-lowness.\u2019  That  is  why  \u2018the  phase  we  are  now ",
  "dealing  with  does  not  exhaust  all  the  possibilities  of  struggle.\u2019  ",
  "In keeping with his basic philosophy of non-violence, and being ",
  "basically  a  19th  century  liberal  and  believer  in  rational ",
  "discussion, Gandhiji was opposed to exercising compulsion even ",
  "on the orthodox supporters of untouchability, whom he described ",
  "as the Sanatanists. Even they had to be tolerated and converted ",
  "and won over by persuasion, \u2018by appealing to their reason and ",
  "their  hearts.\u2019  His  fasts,  he  said,  were  not  directed  against  his ",
  "opponents  or  meant  to  coerce  them  into  opening  temples  and ",
  "wells  etc.;  they  were  directed  towards  friends  and  followers  to ",
  "goad them and inspire them to redouble their anti-untouchability ",
  "work.  ",
  "Gandhiji\u2019s  Harijan  campaign  included  a  programme  of ",
  "internal reform by Harijans: promotion of education, cleanliness ",
  "and hygiene, giving up the eating of carrion and beef, giving up ",
  "liquor and the abolition of untouchability among themselves. But ",
  "it did not include a militant struggle by the Harijans themselves ",
  "through  Satyagraha,  breaking  of  caste  taboos,  mass ",
  "demonstrations,  picketing,  and  other  forms  of  protests.  At  the ",
  "same time, he was aware that his Harijan movement \u2018must cause ",
  "daily increasing awakening among the Harijans\u2019 and that in time ",
  "\u2018whether the savarna Hindus like it or not, the Harijans would ",
  "make good their position.\u2019  ",
  "Gandhiji  repeatedly  stressed  that  the  Harijan  movement ",
  "was not a political movement but a movement to purify Hinduism ",
  "and Hindu  society. But he was also aware  that the movement ",
  "\u2018will produce great political consequences,\u2019 just as untouchability ",
  "poisoned \u2018our entire social and political fabric.\u2019 In fact, not only ",
  "did Harijan work,  along with  other items of constructive work, ",
  "enable  the  Congress  cadre  to  keep  busy  in  its  non-mass ",
  "movement  phases,  it  also  gradually  carried  the  message  of ",
  "nationalism  to  the  Harijans,  who  also  happened  to  be ",
  "agricultural  labourers  in  most  parts  of  the  country,  leading  to 289 | From Karachi to Wardha: The Years from 1932-34   ",
  " ",
  "their increasing participation in the national as well as peasant ",
  "movements. ",
