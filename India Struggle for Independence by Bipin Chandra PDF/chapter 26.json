  "CHAPTER 26. TWENTY-EIGHT MONTHS  ",
  "                      OF CONGRESS RULE  ",
  "  ",
  "After  a  few  months\u2019  tussle  with  the  Government,  the ",
  "Congress Working Committee decided to accept office under the ",
  "Act of 1935. During July, it formed Ministries in six provinces: ",
  "Madras,  Bombay,  Central  Provinces,  Orissa,  Bihar  and  U.P. ",
  "Later,  Congress  Ministries  were  also  formed  in  the  North-West ",
  "Frontier  Province  and  Assam.  To  guide  and  coordinate  their ",
  "activities  and  to  ensure  that  the  British  hopes  of  the ",
  "provincialization  of  the  Congress  did  not  materialize,  a  central ",
  "control board known as the Parliamentary Sub-Committee was ",
  "formed,  with  Sardar  Patel,  Maulana  Abul  Kalam  Azad  and ",
  "Rajendra Prasad as members. Thus began a novel experiment \u2014 ",
  "a party which was committed to liquidate British rule took charge ",
  "of administration under a constitution which was framed by the ",
  "British and which yielded only partial state power to the Indians; ",
  "this  power  could  moreover  be  taken  away  from  the  Indians ",
  "whenever the imperial power so desired. The Congress was now ",
  "to function both as a  government in the  provinces and as the ",
  "opposition vis-a-vis the Central Government where effective state ",
  "power  lay.  It  was  to  bring  about  social  reforms  through  the ",
  "legislature and administration in the provinces and at the same ",
  "time  carry  on  the  struggle  for  independence  and  prepare  the ",
  "people for the next phase of mass struggle. Thus the Congress ",
  "had to implement its strategy of Struggle-Truce-Struggle (S-T-S\u2019) ",
  "in a historically unique situation.\u2019  ",
  "As  Gandhiji  wrote  on the meaning of office acceptance  in ",
  "Harijan on 7 August 1937: \u2018These offices have to be held lightly, ",
  "not  tightly.  They  are  or  should  be  crowns  of  thorns,  never  of ",
  "renown. Offices have been taken in order to see if they enable us ",
  "to quicken the pace at which we are moving towards our goal.\u2019 ",
  "Earlier he had advised Congressmen to use the Act of 1935 \u2018in a ",
  "manner not expected by them (the British) and by refraining from ",
  "using it in the way intended by them.\u2019 ",
  " 320 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "* ",
  "The formation of the Ministries by the Congress changed the ",
  "entire psychological atmosphere in the country. People felt as if ",
  "they were breathing the very air of victory and people\u2019s power, for ",
  "was it not a great achievement that khadi clad men and women ",
  "who had been in prison until just the other day were now ruling ",
  "in  the  secretariat  and  the  officials  who  were  used  to  putting ",
  "Congressmen in jail would now be taking orders from them? The ",
  "exhilarating atmosphere  of the times is, perhaps, best brought ",
  "out by the following passage from Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s Discovery ",
  "of India: \u2018There was a sense of immense relief as of the lifting of a ",
  "weight which had been oppressing the people; there was a release ",
  "of long- suppressed mass energy which was evident everywhere . ",
  ". . At the headquarters of the Provincial Governments, in the very ",
  "citadels  of  the  old  bureaucracy,  many  a  symbolic  scene  was ",
  "witnessed. . . Now, suddenly, hordes of people, from the city and ",
  "the  village,  entered  these  sacred  precincts  and  roamed  about ",
  "almost at will. They were interested in anything; they went into ",
  "the Assembly Chamber, where the sessions used to be held; they ",
  "even  peeped  into  the  Ministers\u2019  rooms.  It  was  difficult  to  stop ",
  "them for  they  no longer felt as  outsiders; they had a sense of ",
  "ownership in all this . . . The policemen and the orderlies with ",
  "shining  daggers  were  paralyzed;  the  old  standards  had  fallen; ",
  "European  dress,  symbol  of  position  and  authority,  no  longer ",
  "counted. It was difficult to distinguish between members of the ",
  "Legislatures and the peasants and townsmen who came in such ",
  "large numbers.\u2019 ",
  "There  was  an  immense  increase  in  the  prestige  of  the ",
  "Congress  as  an  alternative  power  that  would  look  after  the ",
  "interests of the masses, especially of the peasants. At the same ",
  "time, the Congress had got an opportunity to demonstrate that it ",
  "could  not only lead the people in mass struggles  but also use ",
  "state power for their benefit.  ",
  "The  responsibility  was,  of  course,  tremendous.  However, ",
  "there  were  limitations  on  the  Congress  Ministries\u2019  power  and ",
  "financial  resources.  They  could  obviously  not  change  the ",
  "basically imperialist character of the administration; they could ",
  "not introduce a radical era. But, within the narrow limits of their  ",
  "321 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "powers, and the time available to them (their tenure lasted only ",
  "two  years  and  four  months),  they  did  try  to  introduce  some ",
  "reforms,  take  some  ameliorative  measures,  and  make  some ",
  "improvement in the condition of the people \u2014 to give the people a ",
  "glimpse of the future Swaraj.  ",
  "The Congress Ministers set an example in plain living. They ",
  "reduced their own salaries drastically from Rs. 2000 to Rs. 500 ",
  "per month. They were easily accessible to the common people. ",
  "And in a very short time, they did pass a very large amount of ",
  "ameliorative  legislation,  trying  to  fulfil  many  of  the  promises ",
  "made in the Congress election manifesto.  ",
  "* ",
  "The  commitment  of  the  Congress  to  the  defence  and ",
  "extension of civil liberties was as old as the Congress itself, and it ",
  "is  hardly  surprising,  therefore,  that  the  Congress  Ministries ",
  "registered  major  achievements  in  this  sphere.  All  emergency ",
  "powers  acquired  by  the  provincial  governments  during  1932, ",
  "through Public Safety Acts and the like, were repealed; bans on ",
  "illegal political organizations such as the Hindustan Seva Dal and ",
  "Youth Leagues and on political books and journals were lifted. ",
  "Though the ban on the Communist Party remained, since it was ",
  "imposed by the Central Government and could only be lifted on ",
  "its  orders,  the  Communists  could  in  effect  now  function  freely ",
  "and  openly  in  the  Congress  provinces.  All  restrictions  on  the ",
  "press  were  removed.  Securities  taken  from  newspapers  and ",
  "presses  were  refunded  and  pending  prosecutions  were ",
  "withdrawn.  The  blacklisting  of  newspapers  for  purposes  of ",
  "government  advertising  was  given  up.  Confiscated  arms  were ",
  "returned and forfeited arms licenses were restored.  ",
  "Of  all  the  British  functionaries,  the  ones  the  people  were ",
  "most  afraid  of,  as  also  hated,  were  the  police.  On  21  August ",
  "1937,  after  the  formation  of  the  Ministries,  Gandhiji  wrote, ",
  "\u2018Indeed,  the  triumph  of  the  Congress  will  be  measured  by  the ",
  "success  it  achieves  in  rendering  the  police  and  military ",
  "practically idle. . . The best and the only effective way to wreck ",
  "the existing Constitution is for the Congress to prove conclusively ",
  "that  it  can  rule  without  the  aid  of  military  and  with  the  least ",
  " 322 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "possible assistance of the police . . .\u2018 In the Congress provinces, ",
  "police powers were curbed and the reporting of public speeches ",
  "and  the  shadowing  of  political  workers  by  CID  (Central ",
  "Investigation Department) agents stopped.  ",
  "One  of  the  first  acts  of  the  Congress  Government  was  to ",
  "release  thousands  of  political  prisoners  and  detenus  and  to ",
  "cancel  internment  and  deportation  orders  on  political  workers. ",
  "Many  of  the  revolutionaries  involved  in  the  Kakori  and  other ",
  "conspiracy cases were released. But problems remained in U.P. ",
  "and  Bihar  where  several  revolutionaries  convicted  of  crimes ",
  "involving violence remained in jails. Most of these prisoners had ",
  "earlier been sent to kala pani (Cellular Jail in Andamans) from ",
  "where  they  had  been  transferred  to  their  respective  provinces ",
  "after  they  had  gone  on  a  prolonged  hunger  strike  during  July ",
  "1937. In February 1938, there were fifteen such prisoners in U.P. ",
  "and twenty-three in Bihar. Their release required consent by the ",
  "Governors which was refused. But the Congress Ministries were ",
  "determined  to  release  them.  The  Ministries  of  U.P.  and  Bihar ",
  "resigned on this issue on 15 February. The problem was finally ",
  "resolved through negotiations. All the prisoners in both provinces ",
  "were released by the end of March.  ",
  "The difference between the Congress provinces and the non-",
  "Congress provinces of Bengal and Punjab was most apparent in ",
  "this  realm.  In  the  latter,  especially  in  Bengal,  civil  liberties ",
  "continued to be curbed and revolutionary prisoners and detenus, ",
  "kept for years in prison without trial, were not released despite ",
  "repeated hunger strikes by the prisoners and popular movements ",
  "demanding their release.  ",
  "In Bombay, the Government also took steps to restore to the ",
  "original  owners  lands  which  had  been  confiscated  by  the ",
  "Government as a result of the no-tax campaign during the Civil ",
  "Disobedience  Movement  in  1930.  It,  too,  had  to  threaten ",
  "resignation before it could persuade the Governor to agree. The ",
  "pensions  of  officials  dismissed  during  1930  and  1932  for  ",
  "sympathizing with the movement were also restored. There were, ",
  "however, certain blemishes on the Congress ministerial record in ",
  "this respect. In July 1937, Yusuf Meherally, a Socialist leader, ",
  "was  prosecuted  by  the  Madras  Government  for  making  an ",
  "inflammatory speech in Malabar, though he was soon let off. In  ",
  "323 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "October  1937,  the  Madras  Government  prosecuted  S.S. ",
  "Batliwala, another Congress Social leader, for making a seditious ",
  "speech and sentenced him to six months\u2019 imprisonment. There ",
  "was a furore in the Congress ranks led by Jawaharlal Nehru, for ",
  "this action went against the well-known Congress position that ",
  "nobody should be prosecuted for making a speech and least of all ",
  "for a speech against colonial rule. During the discussion on the ",
  "subject in the Congress Working Committee, Nehru, reportedly, ",
  "asked C. Rajagopalachari, the Premier of Madras (the head of the ",
  "Provincial  ministry  was  then  known  as  Premier  and  not  Chief ",
  "Minister as now is the case): \u2018Do you mean to say that if I come to ",
  "Madras  and  make  a  similar  speech  you  would  arrest  me?\u2019  \u2018I ",
  "would,\u2019 the latter is said to have replied. In the end Batliwala was ",
  "released  and  went  around  Madras  Presidency  making  similar ",
  "speeches.  The  affair  proved  to  be  an  exception;  but  it  bred  a ",
  "certain suspicion regarding the future attitude of the Congress ",
  "Right wing.  ",
  "Much  worse  was  the  mentality  of  a  few  of  the  right-wing ",
  "Congress  ministers.  For  instance,  K.M.  Munshi,  the  Home ",
  "Minister  of  Bombay,  and  a  light-weight  within  the  Congress ",
  "leadership, used the C1D to watch the Communists and other ",
  "left-wing Congressmen, earning a rebuke from Jawaharlal Nehru: ",
  "\u2018You  have  already  become  a  police  officer.\u20197  The  Madras ",
  "Government,  too,  used  the  police  to  shadow  radical ",
  "Congressmen. These blemishes have, however, to be seen in the ",
  "larger  context  of  the  vast  expansion  of  civil  liberties  even  in ",
  "Bombay and Madras. Moreover, the mass of Congressmen were ",
  "vigilant  on  this  question.  Led  by  the  left-wing,  they  exerted ",
  "intense pressure on the right-wing Congress ministers to avoid ",
  "tampering with civil liberties.  ",
  "* ",
  "The Congress Ministries tried to give economic relief to the ",
  "peasants and the workers as quickly as possible. The Congress ",
  "had succeeded, in the past, in acquiring massive support among ",
  "them by exposing the roots of their poverty in colonial structure ",
  "and policy, appealing to their nationalism, leading them in anti-",
  "imperialist  struggles,  and  organizing  and  supporting  their ",
  "struggles  around  their  economic  demands.  Now  that  the ",
  " 324 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "Congress had acquired some elements of state and administrative ",
  "power,  it  was  necessary  to  use  these  powers  to  improve  their ",
  "economic condition, and, thus, consolidate Congress support.  ",
  "The  strategy  of  Congress  agrarian  legislation  was  worked ",
  "out  within  certain  broad  parameters.  First,  the  Congress  was ",
  "committed by its election manifesto and the election campaign to ",
  "a policy of agrarian reform through reform of the system of land ",
  "tenures and the reduction of rent, land revenue and the burden ",
  "of  debt.  The  Congress  had  asked  rural  voters  to  vote  for  its ",
  "candidates by making large promises in this respect. The voters ",
  "had taken them seriously; for example, according to government ",
  "reports  from  Pratapgarh  in  U.P.,  on  election  day  \u2018a  very  large ",
  "number  of  voters  had  brought  with  them  pieces  of  dried  cow ",
  "dung  to  the  various  polling  stations  where  these  were  lighted ",
  "and, according to the tenants, \u201cbedakhlis\u201d, i.e., ejectment orders, ",
  "were burnt once for all. ",
  "The Congress could not attempt a complete overhaul of the ",
  "agrarian  structure  by  completely  eliminating  the  zamindari ",
  "system.  This,  for  two  reasons,  According  to  the  constitutional ",
  "structure of the 1935 Act, the provincial Ministries did not have ",
  "enough powers to do so. They also suffered from an extreme lack ",
  "of financial resources, for the lion\u2019s share of India\u2019s revenues was ",
  "appropriated  by  the  Government  of  India.  The  Congress ",
  "Ministries  could  also  not  touch  the  existing  administrative ",
  "structure,  whose  sanctity  was  guarded  by  the  Viceroy\u2019s  and ",
  "Governor\u2019s powers. What is more important, the strategy of class ",
  "adjustment  also  forbade  it.  A  multi-class  movement  could ",
  "develop only by balancing or adjusting various, mutually clashing ",
  "class  interests. To unite all the Indian  people in their struggle ",
  "against colonialism, the main enemy of the time, it was necessary ",
  "to  make  such  an  adjustment.  The  policy  had  to  be  that  of ",
  "winning  over  or  at  least  neutralizing  as  large  a  part  of  the ",
  "landlord  classes  as  possible  so  as  to  isolate  the  enemy  and ",
  "deprive him of all social support within India. This was even more ",
  "necessary  because,  in  large  parts  of  the  country,  the  smaller ",
  "landlords were active participants in the national movement. This ",
  "was  recognized  by  most  of  the  leaders  of  the  time.  Swami ",
  "Sahajanand, the militant peasant leader of Bihar, for example, ",
  "wrote in his memoirs: \u2018As a national organization, the Congress is ",
  "the  forum  of  all  classes.  All  the  classes  are  a  part  of  the  ",
  "325 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "Congress. It represents all sections and classes. This is the claim ",
  "of the Congress and this is desirable also . . . The major function ",
  "of the Congress is to maintain harmony between different classes ",
  "and to further its struggle while doing so. ",
  "There  was  also  the  constraint  of  time.  The  Congress ",
  "leadership  knew  that  their  Ministries  would  not  last  long  and ",
  "would  have  to  quit  soon  as  the  logic  of  their  politics  was  to ",
  "confront imperialism and not cooperate with it. As Nehru put it ",
  "later in his Discovery of India, a \u2018sense of impending crisis was ",
  "always present; it was inherent in the situation.\u2019 Even when the ",
  "Congress had accepted office, the usual figure given for longevity ",
  "of  the  policy  was  two  years.  The  time  constraint  became  even ",
  "more  apparent  as  war  clouds  gathered  in  Europe  from  1938 ",
  "onwards. The Congress Ministries had, therefore, to act rapidly ",
  "and achieve as much as possible in the short time available to ",
  "them.  ",
  "Further,  nearly  all  the  Congress-run  states  (that  is,  U.P., ",
  "Bihar,  Bombay,  Madras  and  Assam)  had  reactionary  second ",
  "chambers in the form of legislative councils, which were elected ",
  "on a very narrow franchise \u2014 while the number of voters for the ",
  "assemblies in these states was over 17.5 million, it was less than ",
  "70  thousand  for  the  second  chambers.  These  were,  therefore, ",
  "dominated by landlords, capitalists and moneylenders, with the ",
  "Congress forming a small minority. As a majority  in  the lower ",
  "house  was  not  enough,  in  order  to  get  any  legislation  passed ",
  "through  the  second  chamber,  the  Congress  had  to ",
  "simultaneously  pressure  their  upper  class  elements  and ",
  "conciliate  them.  Thus  the  Bihar  Government  negotiated  a ",
  "compromise  with  the  zamindars  on  its  tenancy  bills  while  the ",
  "U.P.  Government  conciliated  the  moneylender  and  merchant ",
  "members of its upper house by going slow on debt legislation so ",
  "that their support could be secured for tenancy legislation.  ",
  "Finally, the agrarian structure of various parts of India had ",
  "developed  over  the  centuries  and  was  extremely  complex  and ",
  "complicated.. There was not even enough information about its ",
  "various components \u2014 land rights, for instance. The problem of ",
  "debt  and  money  lending  was  also  integrated  with  peasant ",
  "production and livelihood in too complex a manner to be tackled ",
  "by  an  easy  one-shot  solution.  Consequently,  any  effort  at ",
  " 326 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "structural reform was bound to be an extremely formidable and ",
  "time-consuming  operation,  as  was  to  be  revealed  later  after ",
  "independence  when  the  Congress  and  the  Communists ",
  "attempted to transform the agrarian structure in different states ",
  "of the Indian union.  ",
  "Within  these  constraints,  the  agrarian  policy  of  the ",
  "Congress  Ministries  went  a  long  way  towards  promoting  the ",
  "interests of the peasantry. Agrarian legislation by these Ministries ",
  "differed from province to province depending on differing agrarian ",
  "relations, the mass base of the Congress, the class composition ",
  "and  the  outlook  of  the  provincial  Congress  organization  and ",
  "leadership and the nature and extent of peasant mobilization. In ",
  "general,  it  dealt  with  questions  of  tenancy  rights,  security  of ",
  "tenure  and  rents  of  the  tenants  and  the  problem  of  rural ",
  "indebtedness.  ",
  "To  enumerate  the  achievements  of  the  Ministries,  in  this ",
  "regard, briefly: In U.P. a tenancy act was passed in October 1939 ",
  "which  gave  all  statutory  tenants  both  in  Agra  and  Oudh  full ",
  "hereditary  rights  in  their  holdings  while  taking  away  the ",
  "landlord\u2019s right to prevent the growth of occupancy. The rents of ",
  "hereditary tenants could be changed only after ten years, while ",
  "restrictions  were  placed  on  the  rights  of  landlords  to  enhance ",
  "rents even after this period. A tenant could no longer be arrested ",
  "or imprisoned for non-payment of rent. All illegal exactions such ",
  "as nazrana (forced gifts) and begar (forced unpaid labour) were ",
  "abolished.  In  Bihar,  the  new  tenancy  legislation  was  passed ",
  "mainly in 1937 and 1938, that is, more quickly than in U.P. More ",
  "radical than that  of U.P. in most respects, its main provisions ",
  "were: All increases in rent made since 1911 were abolished; this ",
  "was estimated to mean a reduction of about twenty-five per cent ",
  "in rent. The rent was also reduced if the prices had fallen, during ",
  "the currency of the existing rent, the deterioration of soil and the ",
  "neglect of irrigation by the landlord. Occupancy ryots were given ",
  "the absolute right to transfer their holding on the payment of a ",
  "nominal amount of two per cent of rent to the landlord. A point of ",
  "radical  departure  was  the  grant  to  under-ryots  of  occupancy ",
  "rights if they had cultivated the land for twelve years. Existing ",
  "arrears of rent were substantially reduced and the rate of interest ",
  "on arrears was reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 per cent. The landlord\u2019s ",
  "share in case of share-cropping was not to exceed 9/20 of the  ",
  "327 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "produce. Lands which had been sold in the execution of decrees ",
  "for the payment of arrears between 1929 and 1937 (bakasht land) ",
  "were to be restored to previous tenants on payment of half the ",
  "amount  of  arrears.  The  landlord\u2019s  power  to  realize  rent  was ",
  "greatly  reduced  \u2014  the  tenant  could  no  longer  be  arrested  or ",
  "imprisoned on this account, nor could his immovable property be ",
  "sold  without  his  consent.  Landlords  were  forbidden  from ",
  "charging  illegal  dues;  any  violation  would  lead  to  six  months ",
  "imprisonment.  Occupancy  tenants  could  no  longer  be  ejected ",
  "from  their  holdings  for  non-payment  of  rent.  In  fact,  the  only ",
  "right  that  the  landlord  retained  was  the  right  to  get  his  rent ",
  "which was reduced significantly.  ",
  "In Orissa, a tenancy bill was passed in May 1938 granting ",
  "the  right  of  free  transfer  of  occupancy  holdings,  reducing  the ",
  "interest on arrears of rent from 12.5 to 6 per cent and abolishing ",
  "all illegal levies on tenants. Another bill passed in February 1938 ",
  "reduced all rents in the zamindari areas, transferred in the recent ",
  "past  from  Madras  presidency  to  Orissa,  to  the  rate  of  land ",
  "revenue payable for similar lands in the nearest ryotwari areas ",
  "plus  12.5  per  cent  as  compensation  to  the  zamindars.  The ",
  "Governor  refused  to  give  assent  to  the  bill  as  it  would  have ",
  "reduced  the  zamindars\u2019  incomes  by  fifty  to  sixty  per  cent.  ",
  "In Madras, a committee under the chairmanship of T. Prakasam ",
  "(1872-1957),  the  Revenue  Minister,  recommended  that  in  the ",
  "areas under Permanent Zamindari Settlement the ryot and not ",
  "the zamindar  was the  owner of the soil and that therefore the ",
  "level of rents prevailing when the Settlement was made in 1802 ",
  "should be restored. This would have reduced the rents by about ",
  "two-thirds  and  would  have  meant  virtual  liquidation  of  the ",
  "zamindari  system.  The  Premier,  C.  Rajagopalachari,  gave  full ",
  "support to the report. He also rejected the idea of compensating ",
  "the  zamindars.  The  Legislative  Assembly  passed,  in  January ",
  "1939, a resolution accepting the recommendations, but before a ",
  "bill could be drafted, the Ministry resigned.  ",
  "Measures of tenancy reform, usually extending security of ",
  "tenure  to  tenants  in  landlord  areas,  were  also  carried  in  the ",
  "legislatures of Bombay, the Central Provinces and the North-West ",
  "Frontier  Province.  The  agrarian  legislation  of  the  Congress ",
  "Ministries thus improved and secured the status of millions of ",
  "tenants in zamindari areas. The basic system of landlordism was, ",
  " 328 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "of  course,  not  affected.  Furthermore,  it  was,  in  the  main, ",
  "statutory and occupancy tenants who benefited. The interests of ",
  "the  sub-tenants  of  the  occupancy  tenants  were  overlooked. ",
  "Agricultural labourers were also not affected. This was partially ",
  "because  these two  sections had not  yet been mobilized by the ",
  "kisan  sabhas,  nor  had  they  become  voters  because  of  the ",
  "restricted franchise  under the Act of 1935. Consequently, they ",
  "could  not  exert  pressure  on  the  Ministries  through  either ",
  "elections or the peasant movement.  ",
  "Except  for  U.P.  and  Assam,  the  Congress  Government ",
  "passed a series of stringent debtors\u2019 relief acts which provided for ",
  "the regulation of the moneylenders\u2019 business -\u2014 provisions of the ",
  "acts  included  measures  such  as  the  cancellation  or  drastic ",
  "reduction of accumulated interest ranging from 6.25 per cent in ",
  "Madras to 9 per cent in Bombay and Bihar. These Governments ",
  "also  undertook  various  rather  modest  rural  reconstruction ",
  "programmes.  In  Bombay  40,000  dublas  or  tied  serfs  were ",
  "liberated. Grazing fees in the forests were abolished in Bombay ",
  "and  reduced  in  Madras.  While  the  tenancy  bills  were  strongly ",
  "opposed by the landlords, the debtors\u2019 relief bills were opposed ",
  "not  only  by  the  moneylenders  but  also  by  lawyers,  otherwise ",
  "supporters of the Congress, because they derived a large part of ",
  "their income from debt litigation.  ",
  "* ",
  "The Congress Ministries adopted, in general. a pro-labour ",
  "stance. Their basic approach was to advance workers\u2019 interests ",
  "while promoting industrial peace, reducing the resort to strikes ",
  "as  far  as  possible,  establishing  conciliation  machinery, ",
  "advocating compulsory arbitration before resorting to strikes, and ",
  "creating goodwill between labour and capital with the Congress ",
  "and its ministers assuming the role of intermediaries, while, at ",
  "the same time, striving to improve the conditions of the workers ",
  "and  secure  wage  increases.  This  attitude  alarmed  the  Indian ",
  "capitalist class which now felt the need to organize itself to press ",
  "the \u2018provincial governments to hasten slowly\u2019 on such matters.\u2019  ",
  "Immediately  after  assuming  office,  the  Bombay  Ministry ",
  "appointed  a  Textile  Enquiry  Committee  which  recommended, ",
  "among other improvements, the increase of wages amounting to a  ",
  "329 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "crore  of  rupees.  Despite  mill  owners  protesting  against  the ",
  "recommendations,  they  were  implemented.  In  November  1938, ",
  "the Governments passed the Industrial Disputes Act which was ",
  "based  on  the  philosophy  of  \u2018class  collaboration  and  not  class ",
  "conflict,\u2019 as the Premier B.G. Kher put it. The emphasis in the Act ",
  "was on conciliation, arbitration and negotiations in place of direct ",
  "action. The Act was also designed to prevent lightning strikes and ",
  "lockouts.  The  Act  empowered  the  Government  to  refer  an ",
  "industrial dispute to the Court of Industrial Arbitration. No strike ",
  "or  lock-out  could  occur  for  an  interim  period  of  four  months ",
  "during  which  the  Court  would  give  its  award.  The  Act  was ",
  "strongly  opposed  by  Left  Congressmen,  including  Communists ",
  "and Congress Socialists, for restricting the freedom to strike and ",
  "for laying down a new complicated procedure for registration of ",
  "trade  unions,  which,  they  said,  would  encourage  unions ",
  "promoted  by  employers  in  Madras,  too,  the  Government ",
  "promoted  the  policy  of  \u2018internal  settlement\u2019  of  labour  disputes ",
  "through  government  sponsored  conciliation  and  arbitration ",
  "proceedings.  In  U.P.,  Kanpur  was  the  seat  of  serious  labour ",
  "unrest as the workers expected active support from the popularly ",
  "elected Government. A major strike occurred in May 1938. The ",
  "Government  set  up  a  Labour  Enquiry  Committee,  headed  by ",
  "Rajendra Prasad. The Committee\u2019s recommendations included an ",
  "increase in workers\u2019 wages with a minimum wage of Rs. 15 per ",
  "month, formation of an arbitration board, recruitment of labour ",
  "for  all  mills  by  an  independent  board,  maternity  benefits  to ",
  "women workers, and recognition of the Left- dominated Mazdur ",
  "Sabha by the employers. But the employers, who had refused to ",
  "cooperate  with  the  Committee,  rejected  the  report.  They  did, ",
  "however, in the end, because of a great deal of pressure from the ",
  "Government,  adopt  its  principal  recommendations.  A  similar ",
  "Bihar  Labour  Enquiry  Committee  headed  by  Rajendra  Prasad ",
  "was  set  up  in  1938.  It  too  recommended  the  strengthening  of ",
  "trade  union  rights,  an  improvement  in  labour  conditions,  and ",
  "compulsory conciliation and arbitration to be tried before a strike ",
  "was declared.  ",
  "* ",
  "The  Congress  Governments  undertook  certain  other ",
  "measures  of  social  reform  and  welfare.  Prohibition  was ",
  " 330 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "introduced in selected areas in different states. Measures for the ",
  "advancement of untouchables or Harijans (children of God), as ",
  "Gandhiji  called  them,  including  the  passing  of  laws  enabled ",
  "Harijans to enter temples. and to get free access to public office, ",
  "public sources of water such as wells and ponds, roads, means of ",
  "transport,  hospitals,  educational  and  other  similar  institutions ",
  "maintained  out  of  public  funds,  and  restaurants  and  hotels. ",
  "Moreover,  no  court  or  public  authority  was  to  recognize  any ",
  "custom or usage which imposed any civil disability on Harijans. ",
  "The number of scholarships and freeships for Harijan students ",
  "was  increased.  Efforts  were  made  to  increase  the  number  of ",
  "Harijans in police and other government services.  ",
  "The Congress Ministries paid a lot of attention to primary, ",
  "technical and higher education and public health and sanitation. ",
  "Education for girls and Harijans was expanded. In particular, the ",
  "Ministries  introduced  basic  education  with  an  emphasis  on ",
  "manual  and  productive  work.  Mass  literacy  campaigns  among ",
  "adults  were  organized.  Support  and  subsidies  were  given  to ",
  "khadi, spinning and village industries. Schemes of prison reforms ",
  "were taken up. The Congress Governments removed impediments ",
  "in  the  path  of  indigenous  industrial  expansion  and,  in  fact, ",
  "actively attempted to promote several modern industrial ventures ",
  "such as automobile manufacture.  ",
  "The Congress Governments also joined the effort to develop ",
  "planning through the National Planning Committee appointed in ",
  "1938 by the Congress President Subhas Bose.  ",
  "* ",
  "It was a basic aspect of the Congress strategy that in the ",
  "non-mass  struggle  phases  of  the  national  movement,  mass ",
  "political  activity  and  popular  mobilization  were  to  continue, ",
  "though within the four-walls of legality, in fact, it was a part of ",
  "the  office-acceptance  strategy  that  offices  would  be  used  to ",
  "promote  mass  political  activity.  Jawaharlal  Nehru,  as  the ",
  "president  of  the  Congress,  for  example,  sent  a  circular  to  all ",
  "Congressmen on 10 July, 1937 emphasizing that organizational ",
  "and other work outside the legislature was to remain the major ",
  "occupation  of  the  Congress  for  \u2018without  it  legislative  activity ",
  "would have little value\u2019 and that \u2018the two forms of activity must  ",
  "331 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "be coordinated together and the masses should be kept in touch ",
  "with whatever we do and consulted about it. The initiative must ",
  "come from the masses.\u201d ",
  "The  question  was  the  forms  this  mass  political  activity ",
  "should take, and how work in administration and legislature was ",
  "to  be  coordinated  with  political  work  outside  and,  equally ",
  "important,  what  attitude  the  popularly  elected  government ",
  "should adopt towards popular agitations, especially those which ",
  "stepped outside the bounds of existing legality? There were no ",
  "historical precedents to learn from or to follow. Different answers ",
  "were found in different provinces. Unfortunately, the subject has ",
  "not been studied  in any depth by historians, except in a case ",
  "study  of  U.P.  by  Visalakshi  Menon.\u2019  According  to  Menon,  the ",
  "coordination of legislative and administrative activities and extra-",
  "parliamentary struggles was quite successful in U.P. There was ",
  "widespread mass mobilization which took diverse forms, from the ",
  "organization of Congress committees in villages to the setting up ",
  "of  popular  organs  of  authority  in  the  form  of  Congress  police ",
  "stations and panchayats dispensing justice under the leadership ",
  "of local Congress committees, from organizing of mass petitions ",
  "to  officials  and  Ministers  to  setting  up  of  Congress  grievance ",
  "committees in the districts to hear local grievances and reporting ",
  "them to  MLAs and Ministers, from mass literacy campaigns to ",
  "explain  to  the  people  the  working  of  the  Ministries,  and  from ",
  "organization  of  local,  district  and  provincial  camps  and ",
  "conferences  to  celebration  of  various  days  and  weeks.  Local ",
  "Congress  committees,  members  of  Legislative  Assembly, ",
  "provincial  and  all-India  level  leaders  and  even  ministers  were ",
  "involved in many of these extra-parliamentary mass mobilization ",
  "programmes. More detailed research is likely to show that not all ",
  "Congress  Governments  were  able  to  coordinate  administration ",
  "with  popular  mobilization,  especially  where  the  right-wing ",
  "dominated  the  \u2018provincial  Congress  and  the  Government. ",
  "Moreover, even in U.P., mass mobilization was losing steam by ",
  "1939.  ",
  "However,  the  dilemma  also  arose  in  another  manner. ",
  "Political  work  outside  the  legislatures  would  involve  organizing ",
  "popular  protest.  How  far  could  a  movement  go  in  organizing ",
  "protests and agitations against itself?  ",
  " 332 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "Could  a party which ran a government be simultaneously ",
  "the  organizer  of  popular  movements  and  enforcer  of  law  and ",
  "order? And what if some of the protests took a violent or extra-",
  "legal form? Could civil liberties have their excess? How should ",
  "the governmental wing of the movement then respond, since it is ",
  "one of the functions of any government \u2014 colonial or nationalist, ",
  "leftist or rightist or centrist --- to see that the existing laws are ",
  "observed, in fact, the issue looks at the very question of the role ",
  "of  the  state  in  modern  society,  whether  capitalist  or  socialist. ",
  "Moreover, part of the strategy of increasing Congress influence or ",
  "rather  hegemony  among  the  people  w  as  dependent  on  the ",
  "demonstration, by the party leading the national movement, of its ",
  "ability  to  govern  and  the  capacity  to  rule.  At  the  same  time, ",
  "existing  laws  were  colonial  laws.  How  far  could  a  regime ",
  "committed  to  their  over-throw  go  in  enforcing  them? ",
  "Furthermore, it was inevitable that, on the one hand, the long ",
  "suppressed masses would try to bring pressure on the Ministries ",
  "to get their demands fulfilled as early as possible, especially as ",
  "they  looked  upon  the  Congress  Ministries  with  \u2018a  sense  of ",
  "ownership\u2019 while, on the other, the satisfaction of these demands ",
  "by  the  Ministries  would  be  slow  because  of  the  constraints ",
  "inherent in working through constitutional processes. The issue ",
  "was,  perhaps,  posed  as  an  easily  solvable  problem  as  far  as ",
  "Congressmen  committed  to  non  violence  were  concerned,  but ",
  "there were many other Congressmen for example, Communists, ",
  "Socialists,  Royists  and  Revolutionary  Terrorists  \u2014  and  non-",
  "Congressmen who were not so committed, who tell that expanded ",
  "civil liberties should be used to turn the masses towards more ",
  "militant or even violent forms of agitation, and who tried to prove ",
  "through  such  agitations  and  inadequacy  of  non-violence,  the ",
  "Congress  strategy  of  S-TS  \u2019and  the  policy  of  the  working  of ",
  "reforms.  Could  governance  and  tolerance,  it\u2019  not  promotion,  of ",
  "violent forms of protest coexist?  ",
  "There  was  one  other  problem.  While  many  Congressmen ",
  "agitated  within  the  perspective  of  accepting  the  Congress ",
  "Ministries  as  their  own  and  their  role  as  one  of  strengthening ",
  "them and the Congress through popular agitations and refrained ",
  "from  creating  situations  in  which  punitive  action  by  the ",
  "Government would become necessary, mans\u2019 others were out to ",
  "expose the \u2018breaches of faith and promises\u2019 by these Ministries ",
  "and show tip the true\u2019 character of the Congress as the political  ",
  "333 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "organ  of  the  upper  classes  and  one  which  was,  perhaps,  no ",
  "different from the imperialist authorities so far as the masses and ",
  "their  agitations  were  concerned,  in  their  turn,  many  of  the ",
  "Congressmen  looked  upon  all  hostile  critics  and  militants  as ",
  "forces of disorder and all situations in which people expressed ",
  "their  feelings  in  an  angry  manner  as  \u2018getting  out  of  hand.\u2019 ",
  "Moreover, Congressmen like C. Rajagopalachari and K.M. Munshi ",
  "did  not  hesitate  to  use  their  respective  state  apparatuses  in  a ",
  "politically repressive manner. Unfortunately, the lull dimensions ",
  "of this dilemma have not been adequately explored by historians ",
  "so  far.  Today  they  can,  perhaps,  be  usefully  analyzed  in  a ",
  "comparative  framework  vis-a-vis  the  functioning  of  the ",
  "Communists and other radical parties as ruling parties in several ",
  "states of the Indian Union after 1947, or as parts of ruling groups ",
  "as seen in France or Portugal, or as rulers in socialist countries.  ",
  "The formation of Congress Ministries and the vast extension ",
  "of  civil  liberties  unleashed  popular  energies  everywhere.  Kisan ",
  "sabhas sprang up in every part of the country and there was an ",
  "immense  growth  in  trade  union  activity  and  membership. ",
  "Student  and  youth  movements  revived  and  burgeoned.  A ",
  "powerful  fillip  was  given  to  the  state  peoples\u2019  movement.  Left ",
  "parties were able to expand manifold. Even though it was under a ",
  "Central Government ban, the Communist Party was able to bring ",
  "out its weekly organ, The National Front, from Bombay. The CSP ",
  "brought out The Congress Socialist and several other journals in ",
  "Indian languages.  Of particular  interest  is the  example  of  Kirti ",
  "Lehar which the Kirti Communists of Punjab brought out from ",
  "Meerut,  U.P.,  because  they  could  not  do  so  in  Unionist-ruled ",
  "Punjab.  ",
  "Inevitably, many of the popular movements clashed with the ",
  "Congress Governments. Even though peasant agitations usually ",
  "took  the  form  of  massive  demonstrations  and  spectacular ",
  "peasant marches, in Bihar, the kisan movement often came in ",
  "frontal confrontation with the Ministry, especially when the Kisan ",
  "Sabha asked the peasants not to pay rent or to forcibly occupy ",
  "landlords\u2019 lands. There were also cases of physical attacks upon ",
  "landlords, big and small, and the looting of crops. Kisan Sabha ",
  "workers popularized Sahajanand\u2019s militant slogans: Logan Lenge ",
  "Kaise, Danda Hamara Zindabad (How will you collect rent, long ",
  "live  our  lathis  or  sticks)  and  Lathi  Men  Sathi  (Lathi  is  my ",
  " 334 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "companion).  Consequently,  there  was  a  breach  in  relations ",
  "between  the  Bihar  kisan  Sabha  and  the  provincial  Congress ",
  "leadership.  ",
  "In Bombay, the AITUC, the Communists, and the followers ",
  "of Dr. BR. Ambedkar organized a strike on 7 November 1938, in ",
  "seventeen out of seventy-seven textile mills against the passage of ",
  "the Industrial Disputes Act. There was some \u2018disorder\u2019 and large-",
  "scale  stone  throwing  at  two  mills  and  some  policemen  were ",
  "injured.  The  police  opened  fire,  killing  two  and  injuring  over ",
  "seventy. The Madras Government (as also the Provincial Congress ",
  "Committee) too adopted a strong  policy towards strikes,  which ",
  "sometimes  took  a  violent  turn.  Kanpur  workers  struck ",
  "repeatedly, sometimes acting violently and attacking the police. ",
  "But they tended to get Congress support.  ",
  "Congress  Ministries  did  not  know  how  to  deal  with ",
  "situations where their own mass base was disaffected. They tried ",
  "to play a mediatory role which was successful in U.P. and Bihar ",
  "and to a certain extent in Madras, but not in Bombay. But, in ",
  "general, they were not able to satisfy the Left- wing critics. Quite ",
  "often  they  treated  all  militant  protests,  especially  trade  union ",
  "struggles,  as  a  law  and  order  problem.  They  took  recourse  to ",
  "Section 144 of the Criminal Code against agitating workers and ",
  "arrested peasant and trade union leaders, even in Kanpur.  ",
  "Jawaharlal  Nehru  was  privately  unhappy  with  the ",
  "Ministries\u2019 response to popular protest but his public stance was ",
  "different.  Then  his  answer  was:  \u2018We  cannot  agitate  against ",
  "ourselves.\u2019  He  tended  \u2018to  stand  up  loyally  for  the  ministers  in ",
  "public and protect them from petty and petulant criticism.\u201d To ",
  "put  a  check  on  the  growing  agitations  against  Congress ",
  "Ministries, the All India Congress Committee passed a resolution ",
  "in  September  1938,  condemning  those,  \u2018including  a  few ",
  "Congressmen,\u2019 who \u2018have been found in the name of civil liberty ",
  "to  advocate  murder,  arson,  looting  and  class  war  by  violent ",
  "means.\u2019  ",
  "\u2018The Congress,\u2019 the resolution went on, \u2018will, consistently with its ",
  "tradition, support measures that may be undertaken by Congress ",
  "governments for the defence of life and property.\u201d ",
  "The Left was highly critical of the Congress Governments\u2019 ",
  "handling of popular protest; it accused them of trying to suppress  ",
  "335 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 organizations. The Communist critique of ",
  "the Congress Ministries was later summed up by R. Palme Dutt: ",
  "\u2018The  experience  of  the  two  years  of  Congress  Ministries ",
  "demonstrated  with  growing  acuteness  the  dangers  implicit  in ",
  "entanglement  in  imperialist  administration  under  a  leadership ",
  "already  inclined  to  compromise.  The  dominant  moderate ",
  "leadership in effective control of the Congress machinery and of ",
  "the  Ministries  was  in  practice  developing  an  increasing ",
  "cooperation with imperialism, was acting more and more openly ",
  "in the interests of the upper-class landlords and industrialists, ",
  "and was showing an increasingly marked hostility to all militant ",
  "expression and forms of mass struggle . . . Hence a new crisis of ",
  "the national movement began to develop.\u201d ",
  "Gandhiji too thought that the policy of ministry formation ",
  "was leading to a crisis. But his angle of vision was very different ",
  "from that of the Communists. To start with, he opposed militant ",
  "agitations  because  he  felt  that  their  overt  to  covert  violent ",
  "character threatened his basic strategy based on non-violence. At ",
  "the beginning of office acceptance, as pointed out earlier, he had ",
  "advised the Congress Ministries to rule without the police and the ",
  "army. Later he began to argue that \u2018violent speech or writing does ",
  "not  come  under  the  protection  of  civil  liberty.\u201d  But  even  while ",
  "bemoaning  the  militancy  and  violence  of  the  popular  protest ",
  "agitations  and  justifying  the  use  of  existing  legal  machinery ",
  "against  them,  Gandhiji  objected  to  the  frequent  recourse  to ",
  "colonial laws and law and order machinery to deal with popular ",
  "agitations.  He  wanted  reliance  to  be  placed  on  the  political ",
  "education  of  the  masses  against  the  use  of  violence.  He ",
  "questioned, for example, the Madras Government\u2019s resort to the ",
  "Criminal  Law  Amendment  Act,  especially  to  its  \u2018obnoxious ",
  "clauses.\u2019 While criticizing Left-wing incitement to class violence, ",
  "he constantly sought to curb Right-wing confrontation with the ",
  "Left.  He  also  defended  the  right  of  the  Socialists  and  the ",
  "Communists to preach and practise their politics in so far as they ",
  "abided  by  Congress  methods.  Gandhiji  was  able  to  see  the ",
  "immense harm that the Congress would suffer in terms of erosion ",
  "of  popular  support,  especially  of  the  workers  and  peasants, ",
  "because of the repeated use of law and order machinery to deal ",
  "with their agitations. This would make it difficult to organize the ",
  "next wave of extra-legal mass movement against colonial rule. He ",
  "thus perceived the inherent dilemma in the situation and dealt ",
  " 336 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "with it in a large number of articles in Haryana during 1938-39. ",
  "This was one major reason why he began to question the efficacy ",
  "of continuing with the policy of office acceptance.\u20198 He wrote in ",
  "December  1938  that  if  the  Congress  Ministries  \u2018find  that  they ",
  "cannot  run  the  State  without  the  use  of  the  police  and  the ",
  "military, it is the clearest possible sign, in terms of non-violence, ",
  "that the Congress should give up office and again wander in the ",
  "wilderness in search of the Holy Grail.\u2019 ",
  "* ",
  "The  period  of  the  Congress  Ministries  witnessed  the ",
  "emergence of serious weaknesses in the Congress. There was a ",
  "great deal of factional strife and bickering both on ideological and ",
  "personal  bases,  a  good  example  of  which  was  the  factional ",
  "squabbles within the Congress Ministry and the Assembly party ",
  "in the Central provinces which led to the resignation of Dr. N.B. ",
  "Khare as premier. The practice of bogus membership made its ",
  "appearance and began to grow. There was a scramble for jobs ",
  "and  positions  of  personal  advantage.  Indiscipline  among ",
  "Congressmen was on the increase everywhere. Opportunists, self-",
  "seekers and careerists, drawn by the lure of associating with a ",
  "party  in  power,  began  to  enter  the  ranks  of  the  Congress  at ",
  "various levels. This was easy because the Congress was an open ",
  "party  which  anybody  could  join.  Many  Congressmen  began  to ",
  "give way to casteism in their search for power.  ",
  "Gandhiji began to feel that \u2018We seem to be weakening from ",
  "within.\u2019 Full of despondency, Gandhiji repeatedly lashed out in ",
  "the columns of Haryana against the growing misuse of office and ",
  "creeping corruption in Congress ranks. \u2018I would go to the length ",
  "of giving the whole Congress organization a decent burial, rather ",
  "than  put  up  with  the  corruption  that  is  rampant,\u2019  he  told  the ",
  "Gandhi  Seva  Sangh  workers  in  May  1939.20  Earlier,  in ",
  "November 1938, he had written in Haryana: \u2018If the Congress is ",
  "not purged of illegalities and irregularities, it will cease to be the ",
  "power it is today and will fail to fulfil expectations when the real ",
  "struggle  faces  the  country.\u2019  Gandhiji,  of  course,  saw  that  this ",
  "slackening of the movement and weakening of the moral fibre of ",
  "Congressmen  was  in  part  inevitable  in  a  phase  of  non-mass  ",
  "337 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "struggle. He, therefore, advised giving up of offices and starting ",
  "preparations for another phase of Satyagraha.  ",
  "Jawaharlal  too  had  been  feeling  for  some  time  that  the ",
  "positive role of the Ministries was getting exhausted. He wrote to ",
  "Gandhiji  on  28  April  1938:  \u20181  feel  strongly  that  the  Congress ",
  "ministries are working inefficiently and not doing much that they ",
  "could do. They are adapting themselves far too much to the old ",
  "order and trying to justify it. But all this, bad as it is, might be ",
  "tolerated. What is far worse is that we are losing the high position ",
  "that we have built up, with so much labour, in the hearts of the ",
  "people.  We  are  sinking  to  the  level  of  ordinary  politicians  who ",
  "have no principles to stand by and whose work is governed by a ",
  "day  to  day  opportunism.  ..  I  think  there  are  enough  men  of ",
  "goodwill  in  the  Congress.  But  their  minds  are  full  of  party ",
  "conflicts and the desire to crush this individual or that group.\u2019  ",
  "The Congress Ministries resigned in October 1939 because ",
  "of  the  political  crisis  brought  about  by  World  War  11.  But ",
  "Gandhiji welcomed the resignations for another reason \u2014 they ",
  "would help cleanse the Congress of the \u2018rampant corruption.\u2019 He ",
  "wrote  to  C.  Rajagopalachari  on  23  October  1939:  \u20181  am  quite ",
  "clear in my mind that what has happened is best for the cause. It ",
  "is a bitter pill I know. But it was needed. It will drive away all the ",
  "parasites from the body. We have been obliged to do wrong things ",
  "which  we  shall  be  able  to  avoid.\u2019  The  resignations  produced ",
  "another positive effect. They brought the Left and the Right in the ",
  "Congress closer because of a common policy on the question of ",
  "participation in the war.  ",
  "* ",
  "In the balance, the legislative and administrative record of ",
  "the Congress Ministries was certainly positive. As R. Coupland ",
  "was  to  remark  in  1944:  \u2018The  old  contention  that  Indian  self-",
  "government was a necessity for any really radical attack on the ",
  "social backwardness of India was thus confirmed.\u2019\u2019 And Nehru, a ",
  "stern critic of the Congress Ministries in 1938- 39, wrote in 1944: ",
  "\u2018Looking  back,  I  am  surprised  at  their  achievements  during  a ",
  "brief period of two years and a quarter, despite the innumerable ",
  "difficulties  that  surrounded  them.\u2019  Even  though  the  Left  was ",
  " 338 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "critical, in the long view even its expectations were fulfilled in a ",
  "large  measure.  In  1935,  Wang  Ming,  in  his  report  on  the ",
  "revolutionary  movements  in  colonial  countries  at  the  6th ",
  "Congress of the Communist International, said in the section on ",
  "India: \u2018Our Indian comrades in attempting to establish a united ",
  "anti-imperialist  front  with  the  National  Congress  in  December ",
  "last  year  put  before  the  latter  such  demands  as  \u201cthe ",
  "establishment  of  an  Indian  workers\u2019  and  peasants\u2019  soviet ",
  "republic,\u201d \u201cconfiscation of all lands belonging to the zamindars ",
  "without  compensation,\u201d  \u201ca  general  strike  as  the  only  effective ",
  "programme  of  action,\u201d  etc.  Such  demands  on  the  part  of  our ",
  "Indian comrades can serve as an example of how not to carry on ",
  "the  tactics  of  the  anti-imperialist  united  front.  .  The  Indian ",
  "communists must formulate a programme of popular demands ",
  "which  could  serve  as  a  platform  for  a  broad  anti-imperialist ",
  "united front . . . this programme for struggle in the immediate ",
  "future  should include approximately the following demands: 1) ",
  "against the slavish constitution, 2) for the immediate liberation of ",
  "all political prisoners, 3) for the abolition of all extraordinary laws ",
  "etc., 4) against the lowering of wages, the lengthening of working ",
  "day and discharge of workers, 5) against burdensome taxes, high ",
  "land rents and against confiscation of peasants\u2019 lands for non-",
  "payment of debts and obligations, and 6) for the establishment of ",
  "democratic rights.\u2019 ",
  "Certainly, the Congress Ministries fulfilled this agenda more ",
  "or less in entirety.  ",
  "One of the great achievements of the Congress Governments ",
  "was their firm handling of the communal riots. They asked the ",
  "district magistrates and  police  officers to take strong action to ",
  "deal with a communal outbreak.  ",
  "The  Congress  leadership  foiled  the  imperialist  design  of ",
  "using constitutional reforms  to weaken the  national movement ",
  "and,  instead  demonstrated  how  the  constitutional  structure ",
  "could be used by a movement aiming at capture of state power to ",
  "further  its  own  aims  without  getting  co-opted.  Despite  certain ",
  "weaknesses, the Congress emerged stronger from the period of ",
  "office acceptance. Nor was the national movement diverted from ",
  "its  main  task  of  fighting  for  self  government  because  of  being ",
  "engaged  in  day-to-day  administration.  Offices  were  used  ",
  "339 | Twenty-Eight Months Of Congress Rule  ",
  " ",
  "successfully  for  enhancing  the  national  consciousness  and ",
  "increasing  the  area  of  nationalist  influence  and  thus ",
  "strengthening the movement\u2019s capacity to wage a mass struggle ",
  "in the future. The movement\u2019s influence was now extended to the ",
  "bureaucracy, especially at the lower levels. And the morale of the ",
  "ICS (Indian Civil Service), one of the pillars of the British Empire, ",
  "suffered a shattering blow. Many ICS officers came to believe that ",
  "the British departure from India was only a matter of time. In ",
  "later years, especially during the Quit India Movement, the fear ",
  "that  the  Congress  might  again  assume  power  in  the  future,  a ",
  "prospect  made  real  by  the  fact  that  Congress  Ministries  had ",
  "already been in power once, helped to neutralize many otherwise ",
  "hostile elements, such as landlords and even bureaucrats, and ",
  "ensured that many of them at least sat on the fence.  ",
  "One  may  quote  in  this  respect  Visalakshi  Menon\u2019s ",
  "judgement:  \u2018From  the  instance  of  the  United  Provinces,  it  is ",
  "obvious  that  there  was  no  popular  disillusionment  with  the ",
  "Congress during the period of the Ministry. Rather, the people ",
  "were able to perceive, in more concrete terms, the shape of things ",
  "to come, if independence were won.\u2019 ",
  "There was also no growth of provincialism or lessening of ",
  "the sense of Indian unity, as the framers of the Act of 1935 and ",
  "of  its  provision  for  Provincial  Autonomy  had  hoped.  The ",
  "Ministries  succeeded  in  evolving  a  common  front  before  the ",
  "Government  of  India.  Despite  factionalism,  the  Congress ",
  "organization  as  a  whole  remained  disciplined.  Factionalism, ",
  "particularly  at  the  top,  was  kept  within  bounds  with  a  strong ",
  "hand  by  the  central  leadership.  When  it  came  to  the  crunch, ",
  "there was also no sticking so office. Acceptance of office thus did ",
  "prove to be just one phase in the freedom struggle. When an all-",
  "India political crisis occurred and the central Congress leadership ",
  "wanted it, the Ministries promptly resigned. And the opportunists ",
  "started leaving.  As the Congress  General  Secretary said at the ",
  "time: \u2018The resignations of the ministries demonstrated to all thou ",
  "who had any doubts that Congress was not out for power and ",
  "office but for the emancipation  of the people of India from the ",
  "foreign yoke.\u2019  ",
  "The Congress also avoided a split between its Left and Right ",
  "wings \u2014 a split which the British were trying to actively promote ",
  " 340 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "since  1934.  Despite  strong  critiques  of  each  other  by  the  two ",
  "wings, they not only remained united but tended to come closer ",
  "to each other, as the crisis at Tripuri showed.  ",
  "Above all, the Congress gained by influencing all sections of ",
  "the people. The process of the growth of Congress and nationalist ",
  "hegemony  in  Indian  society  was  advanced.  If  mass  struggles ",
  "destroyed  one  crucial  element  of  the  hegemonic  ideology  of ",
  "British colonialism by demonstrating that British power was not ",
  "invincible  then  the  sight  of  Indians  exercising  power  shattered ",
  "another  myth  by  which  the  British  had  held  Indians  in ",
  "subjection: that Indians were not fit to rule.   ",
