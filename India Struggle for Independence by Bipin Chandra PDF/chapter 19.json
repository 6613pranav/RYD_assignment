  "CHAPTER 19. THE YEARS OF  ",
  "                      STAGNATION \u2014   ",
  "                      SWARAJISTS, NO- ",
  "                      CHANGERS  ",
  "                            AND GANDHIJI ",
  " ",
  "The  withdrawal  of  the  Non-Cooperation  Movement  in ",
  "February 1922 was followed by the arrest of Gandhiji in March ",
  "and his conviction and imprisonment for six years for the crime ",
  "of spreading disaffection against the Government. The result was ",
  "the spread of disintegration, disorganization and demoralization ",
  "in the nationalist ranks. There arose the danger of the movement ",
  "lapsing into passivity. Many began to question the wisdom of the ",
  "total Gandhian strategy. Others started looking for ways out of ",
  "the impasse.  ",
  "A  new  line  of  political  activity,  which  would  keep  up  the ",
  "spirit of resistance to colonial rule, was now advocated by C.R. ",
  "Das  and  Motilal  Nehru.  They  suggested  that  the  nationalists ",
  "should  end  the  boycott  of  the  legislative  councils,  enter  them, ",
  "expose  them  as  \u2018sham  parliaments\u2019  and  as  \u2018a  mask  which  the ",
  "bureaucracy has put on,\u2019 and obstruct \u2018every work of the council.\u2019 ",
  "This, they argued, would not be giving up non-cooperation but ",
  "continuing  it  in  a  more  effective  form  by  extending  it  to  the ",
  "councils  themselves.  It  would  be  opening  a  new  front  in  the ",
  "battle.  ",
  "C.R. Das as the President of the Congress and Motilal as its ",
  "Secretary  put  forward  this  programme  of  \u2018either  mending  or ",
  "ending\u2019  the  councils  at  the  Gaya  session  of  the  Congress  in ",
  "December  1922.  Another  section  of  the  Congress,  headed  by ",
  "Vallabhbhai  Patel,  Rajendra  Prasad  and  C.  Rajagopalachari, ",
  "opposed the new proposal which was consequently defeated by ",
  " 224 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "1748 to 890 votes. Das and Motilal resigned from their respective ",
  "offices in the Congress and on 1 January 1923 announced the ",
  "formation  of  the  Congress-Khilafat  Swaraj  Party  better  known ",
  "later as the Swaraj Party. Das was the President and Motilal one ",
  "of the Secretaries of the new party. The adherents of the council-",
  "entry programme came to be popularly known as \u2018pro-changers\u2019 ",
  "and  those  still  advocating  boycott  of  the  councils  as  \u2018no\u2014",
  "changers.\u2019  ",
  "The Swaraj Party accepted the Congress programme in its ",
  "entirety except in one respect \u2014 it would take part in elections ",
  "due later in the \u2018ear It declared that it would present the national ",
  "demand for self- government in the councils and in case of its ",
  "rejection its elected members would adopt \u2018a policy of uniform, ",
  "continuous and consistent obstruction within the councils, with ",
  "a view to make the Government through the councils impossible.\u2019 ",
  "The  councils  would,  thus,  be  wrecked  from  within  by  creating ",
  "deadlocks on every measure that came before them.  ",
  "Both Das  (born in 1870)  and Motilal  (born in 1861)  were ",
  "highly successful lawyers who had once been Moderates but had ",
  "accepted  the  politics  of  boycott  and  non-cooperation  in  1920. ",
  "They had given up their legal practice, joined the movement as ",
  "whole time workers and donated to the nation their magnificent ",
  "houses in Calcutta and Allahabad respectively. They were great ",
  "admirers of Gandhiji but were also his political equals. Both were ",
  "brilliant and effective parliamentarians. One deeply religious and ",
  "the  other  a  virtual  agnostic,  both  were  secular  to  the  core. ",
  "Different  in  many  ways,  they  complemented  each  other  and ",
  "formed  a  legendary  political  combination.  Das  was  imaginative ",
  "and emotional and a great orator with the capacity to influence ",
  "and  conciliate  friends  and  foes.  Motilal  was  firm,  coolly ",
  "analytical,  and  a  great  organizer  and  disciplinarian.  They  had ",
  "such absolute trust and confidence in each other that each could ",
  "use  the  other\u2019s  name  for  any  statement  without  prior ",
  "consultation.  ",
  "The  no-changers,  whose  effective  head  was  Gandhiji  even ",
  "though  he  was  in  jail,  argued  for  the  continuation  of  the  full ",
  "programme of boycott and non-cooperation, effective working of ",
  "the  constructive  programme  and  quiet  preparations  for  the ",
  "resumption of the suspended civil disobedience.   ",
  "225 | The Years Of Stagnation \u2014 Swarajists, No-Changers And Gandhiji ",
  "* ",
  "The pro-changers and the no-changers were soon engaged ",
  "in a fierce controversy. There was, of  course, a lot  of common ",
  "ground between the two Both agreed that civil disobedience was ",
  "not possible immediately and that no mass movement could be ",
  "carried on indefinitely or for a prolonged period. Hence, breathing ",
  "time was needed and a temporary retreat from the active phase of ",
  "the movement was on the agenda. Both also accepted that there ",
  "was need to rest and to reinvigorate the anti-imperialist forces, ",
  "overcome demoralization, intensify politicization, widen political ",
  "participation and mobilization, strengthen organization, arid keep ",
  "up the recruitment, training and morale of the cadre. In fact, the ",
  "national movement was facing the basic problem that any mass ",
  "movement has to face: how were they to carry on political work in ",
  "the movements\u2019 non- active phases?  ",
  "It was in the answer to this last question that the two sides ",
  "differed.  The  Swarajists  said  that  work  in  the  councils  was ",
  "necessary to fill in the temporary political void. This would keep ",
  "up the morale of the politicized Indians, fill the empty newspaper ",
  "spaces, and enthuse the people. Electioneering and speeches in ",
  "the councils would provide fresh avenues for political agitation ",
  "and propaganda.  ",
  "Even  without  Congressmen,  said  the  Swarajists,  the ",
  "councils  would  continue  to  function  and,  perhaps,  a  large ",
  "number of people would participate in voting. This would lead to ",
  "the  weakening  of  the  hold  of  the  Congress.  Moreover,  non-",
  "Congressmen would capture positions of vantage and use them ",
  "to weaken the Congress. Why should such vantage points in a ",
  "revolutionary fight be left in the hands of the enemy?\u2019 By joining ",
  "the  councils  and  obstructing  their  work.  Congressmen  would ",
  "prevent  undesirable  elements  from  doing  mischief  or  the ",
  "Government from getting some form of legitimacy for their laws.  ",
  "In other words, the Swarajists claimed that they would transform ",
  "the  legislatures  into  arenas  of  political  struggle  and  that  their ",
  "intention was not to use them, as the Liberals desired, as organs ",
  "for the gradual transformation of the colonial state, but to use ",
  "them as the ground on which the struggle for the overthrow of ",
  "the colonial state was to be carried out.  ",
  " 226 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "The  no-changers  opposed  council-entry  mainly  on  the ",
  "ground  that  parliamentary  work  would  lead  to  the  neglect  of ",
  "constructive  and  other  work  among  the  masses,  the  loss  of ",
  "revolutionary  zeal  and  political  corruption.  The  legislators  who ",
  "would go into the councils with the aim of wrecking them would ",
  "gradually give up the politics of obstruction. get sucked into the ",
  "imperial constitutional framework, and start cooperating with the ",
  "Government  on  petty  reforms  and  piecemeal  legislation ",
  "Constructive work among the masses, on the other hand, would ",
  "prepare them for the next round of civil disobedience.  ",
  "As  the  pro-changer  no-changer  clash  developed,  the ",
  "atmosphere of dismay in nationalist ranks began to thicken, and ",
  "they  began  to  be  haunted  by  the  fear  of  the  repetition  of  the ",
  "disastrous split of 1907. Pressure began to develop on the leaders ",
  "to put a check on their public bickerings.  ",
  "Both groups of leaders began to pull back from the brink ",
  "and move \u2018wards mutual accommodation. This trend was helped ",
  "by several factors. First, the need for unity was felt very strongly ",
  "by all the Congressmen. Secondly, not only the no-changers but ",
  "also  the  Swarajists  realized  that  however  useful  parliamentary ",
  "work  might  be,  the  real  sanctions  which  would  compel  the ",
  "Government to accept national demands would be forged only by ",
  "a mass movement outside the legislatures \u2014 and this would need ",
  "unity.  Lastly,  both  groups  of  leaders  fully  accepted  the ",
  "essentiality of Gandhiji\u2019s leadership.  ",
  "Consequently, in a special session of the Congress held at ",
  "Delhi  in  September  1923,  the  Congress  suspended  all ",
  "propaganda against council entry and permitted Congressmen to ",
  "stand as candidates and exercise their franchise in forthcoming ",
  "elections.  ",
  "* ",
  "Gandhiji  was  released  from  jail  on  5  February  1924  on ",
  "health grounds. He was completely opposed to council-entry as ",
  "also to the obstruction of work in the councils which he believed ",
  "was inconsistent with non-violent non-cooperation. Once again a ",
  "split  in  the  Congress  loomed  on  the  horizon.  The  Government ",
  "very much hoped for and banked on such a split. When releasing  ",
  "227 | The Years Of Stagnation \u2014 Swarajists, No-Changers And Gandhiji ",
  "the  Mahatma, the Bombay Government  had  suggested that  he ",
  "\u2018would denounce the Swarajists for their defection from the pure ",
  "principle  of  non-cooperation,  and  thus  considerably  reduce  in ",
  "legislatures  their  power  for  harm.\u20192  Similarly,  Reading,  the ",
  "Viceroy, told the Secretary of State for India, on 6 June 1924: ",
  "\u2018The  probability  of  a  split  between  Swarajists  and  Gandhiji  is ",
  "increasing . . .  Moonje, (The Swarajist  leader from the Central ",
  "Provinces)  adds  that  the  Swarajists  are  now  driven  to ",
  "concentrating all their energy on breaking Gandhiji\u2019s hold on the ",
  "Congress.\u2019 ",
  "But Gandhiji did not oblige. Step by step, he moved towards ",
  "an  accommodation  with  the  Swarajists.  In  fact,  his  approach ",
  "towards the Swarajists at this stage brings out some of the basic ",
  "features  of  his  political  style,  especially  when  dealing  with  co-",
  "workers  with  whom  he  differed,  and  is  therefore,  worth ",
  "discussing, however briefly.  ",
  "Gandhiji\u2019s  starting  point  was  the  fact  that  even  when ",
  "opposing  the  Swarajist  leaders  he  had  full  trust  in  their ",
  "bonafides. He described their as \u2018the most valued and respected ",
  "leaders\u2019 and as persons who \u2018have made great sacrifices in the ",
  "cause  of  the  country  and  who  yield  to  no  one  in  their  love  of ",
  "freedom of the motherland\u20194 Moreover, he and Das and Motilal ",
  "Nehru throughout maintained warm personal relations based on ",
  "mutual  respect  and  regard.  Immediately  after  his  release, ",
  "Gandhiji refused to publicly comment on council-entry till he had ",
  "discussions with the Swarajist leaders. Even after meeting them, ",
  "while  he  continued  to  believe  in  the  futility  and  even  harmful ",
  "character of the Swarajists\u2019 programme, he remained convinced ",
  "that public opposition to the \u2018settled fact\u2019 of council-entry would ",
  "be counterproductive.  ",
  "The courageous and uncompromising manner in which the ",
  "Swarajists  had  functioned  in  the  councils  convinced  Gandhiji ",
  "that, however politically wrong, they were certainly not becoming ",
  "a limb of imperial administration. To the contrary, he noted, \u2018they ",
  "have shown determination, grit, discipline and cohesion and have ",
  "not  feared  to  carry  their  policy  to  the  point  of  defiance.  Once ",
  "assume  the  desirability  of  entering  Councils  and  it  must  be ",
  "admitted that they have introduced a new spirit into the Indian ",
  "Legislatures.\u201d  ",
  " 228 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "Gandhiji was also pained by the bickerings in the worst of ",
  "taste among the proponents of the two schools. As he wrote in ",
  "April  1924:  \u2018Even  the  \u201cchangers\u201d  and  the  \u201cno-changers\u201d  have ",
  "flung mud against one another. Each has claimed the monopoly ",
  "of truth and, with an ignorant certainty of conviction, sworn at ",
  "the  other  for  his  helpless  stupidity.\u2019  He  was  very  keen  to  end ",
  "such mud-slinging.  ",
  "In  any  case,  felt  Gandhiji,  council  entry  had  already ",
  "occurred and now to withdraw would be \u2018disastrous\u2019 and would ",
  "be \u2018misunderstood\u2019 by the Government and the people \u2018as a rout ",
  "and weakness.\u201d This would further embolden the Government in ",
  "its  autocratic  behaviour  and  repressive  policy  and  add  to  the ",
  "state of political depression among the people.  ",
  "The last straw came when the Government launched a full ",
  "attack on civil liberties and the Swarajists in Bengal in the name ",
  "of fighting terrorism. It promulgated an ordinance on 25 October ",
  "1924  under  which  it  conducted  raids  on  Congress  offices  and ",
  "house  searches  and  arrested  a  large  number  of  revolutionary ",
  "terrorists  and  Swarajists  and  other  Congressmen  including ",
  "Subhas Chandra Bose and two Swarajist members of the Bengal ",
  "legislature, Anil Baran Roy and S.C. Mitra.  ",
  "Perceiving  a  direct  threat  to  the  national  movement, ",
  "Gandhiji\u2019s first reaction was anger. He wrote in Young India on 31 ",
  "October: \u2018The Rowlatt Act is dead but the spirit that prompted it ",
  "is  like  an  evergreen.  So  long  as  the  interest  of  Englishmen  is ",
  "antagonistic to that of Indians, so long must there be anarchic ",
  "crime  or  the  dread  of  it  and  an  edition  of  the  Rowlatt  Act  in ",
  "answer.\u2019  ",
  "As  an  answer  to  the  Government\u2019s  offensive  against  the ",
  "Swarajists, he decided to show his solidarity with the Swarajists ",
  "by  \u2018surrendering\u2019  before  them.  As  he  wrote  in  Young  India:  \u2018I ",
  "would have been false to the country if I had not stood by the ",
  "Swaraj Party in the hour of its need. . . I must stand by it even ",
  "though I do not believe in the efficacy of Council-entry or even ",
  "some of the methods of conducting Council Warfare And again ",
  "\u2018Though an uncompromising No-changer. I must not only tolerate ",
  "their attitude and work with them, but I must even strengthen ",
  "them wherever I can.\u201d  ",
  "229 | The Years Of Stagnation \u2014 Swarajists, No-Changers And Gandhiji ",
  "On 6 November 1924, Gandhiji brought the strife between ",
  "the  Swarajists  and  no-changers  to  an  end,  by  signing  a  joint ",
  "statement with Das and Motilal that the Swarajist Party would ",
  "carry on work in the legislatures on behalf of the Congress and as ",
  "an integral part of the Congress. This decision was endorsed in ",
  "December  at  the  Belgaum  session  of  the  Congress  over  which ",
  "Gandhiji presided. He also gave the Swarajists a majority of seats ",
  "on his Working Committee.  ",
  "* ",
  "Elections to the legislative councils were held in November ",
  "1923. The Swarajist manifesto, released on 14 October, took up a ",
  "strong  anti-  imperialist  position:  \u2018The  guiding  motive  of  the ",
  "British in governing India is to secure the selfish interests of their ",
  "own  country  and  the  so-called  ref  onus  arc  a  mere  blind  to ",
  "further  the  said  interests  under  the  pretence  of  granting ",
  "responsible government to India, the real object being to continue ",
  "the  exploitation  of  the  unlimited  resources  of  the  country  by ",
  "keeping  Indians  permanently  in  a  subservient  position  to ",
  "Britain.\u201d It promised that the Swarajists would wreck the sham ",
  "reforms from within the councils.  ",
  "Even though the Swarajists got only a few weeks to prepare ",
  "for the elections and the franchise was extremely narrow -\u2014 only ",
  "about 6.2 million or less than three per cent had the right to vote ",
  "\u2014 they managed to do quite well. They won forty-two out of 101 ",
  "elected seats in the Central Legislative Assembly they got a clear ",
  "majority in the Central Provinces; they were the largest party in ",
  "Bengal; and they fared quite well in Bombay and U.P., though not ",
  "in Madras and Punjab because of strong casteist and communal ",
  "currents.  ",
  "In  the  Central  Legislative  Assembly,  the  Swarajists ",
  "succeeded  in  building  a  common  political  front  with  the ",
  "Independents led by M.A. Jinnah, the Liberals, and individuals ",
  "such as Madan Mohan Malaviya. They built similar coalitions in ",
  "most  of  the  provinces.  And  they  set  out  to  inflict  defeat  after ",
  "defeat on the Government.  ",
  "The  legislatures,  reformed  in  1919,  had  a  \u2018semblance\u2019  of ",
  "power without any real authority. Though they had a majority of ",
  " 230 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "elected members, the executive at the centre or in the provinces ",
  "was outside their control, being responsible only to the British ",
  "Government  at  home.  Moreover,  the  Viceroy  or  the  Governor ",
  "could certify any legislation, including a budgetary grant, if it was ",
  "rejected in the legislature. The Swarajists forced the Government ",
  "to certify legislation repeatedly at the centre as well as in many of ",
  "the provinces, thus exposing the true character of the reformed ",
  "councils. In March 1925, they succeeded in electing Vithalbhai ",
  "Patel,  a  leading  Swarajist,  as  the  President  of  the  Central ",
  "Legislative Assembly.  ",
  "Though intervening on every issue and often outvoting the ",
  "Government,  the  Swarajists  took  up  at  the  centre  three  major ",
  "sets  of  problems  on  which  they  delivered  powerful  speeches ",
  "which were fully reported in the Press and followed avidly every ",
  "morning by the readers. One was the problem of constitutional ",
  "advance  leading  to  self-Government;  second  of  civil  liberties, ",
  "release of political prisoners, and repeal of repressive laws; and ",
  "third  of  the  development  of  indigenous  industries.  ",
  "In the very first session, Motilal Nehru put forward the national ",
  "demand  for  the  framing  of  a  new  constitution,  which  would ",
  "transfer real power to India. This demand was passed by 64 votes ",
  "to  48.  It  was  reiterated  and  passed  in  September  1925  by  72 ",
  "votes to 45. The Government had also to face humiliation when ",
  "its  demands  for  budgetary  grants  under  different  heads  were ",
  "repeatedly voted out. On one such occasion, Vithalbhai Patel told ",
  "the Government: \u2018We want you to carry on the administration of ",
  "this country by veto and by certification. We want you to treat the ",
  "Government of India Act as a scrap of paper which I am sure it ",
  "has proved to be.\u2019 ",
  "Similarly, the Government was defeated several times on the ",
  "question  of  the  repeal  of  repressive  laws  and  regulations  and ",
  "release of political prisoners. Replying to the official criticism of ",
  "the  revolutionary  terrorists,  C.S.  Ranga  Iyer  said  that  the ",
  "Government officials were themselves \u2018criminals of the worst sort, ",
  "assassins  of  the  deepest  dye,  men  who  are  murdering  the ",
  "liberties  of  a  liberty-loving  race.\u201d  Lala  Lajpat  Rai  said:  ",
  "\u2018Revolutions and revolutionary movements are only natural . . . ",
  "there can be no progress in the world without revolutions and ",
  "revolutionary  movements.\u201d  CR.  Das  was  no  less  critical  of  the ",
  "Government\u2019s  repressive  policy.  He  told  the  Bengal  Provincial  ",
  "231 | The Years Of Stagnation \u2014 Swarajists, No-Changers And Gandhiji ",
  "Conference:  \u2018Repression  is  a  process  in  the  consolidation  of ",
  "arbitrary power \u2014 and I condemn the violence of the Government ",
  "for  repression  is  the  most  violent  form  of  violence  \u2014just  as  I ",
  "condemn violence as a method of winning political liberty.\u201d  ",
  "The Swarajist activity in the legislatures was spectacular by ",
  "any standards. It inspired the politicized persons and kept their ",
  "political  interest  alive.  People  were  thrilled  every  time  the  all-",
  "powerful  foreign  bureaucracy  was  humbled  in  the  councils.  ",
  "Simultaneously, during 1923-24, Congressmen captured a large ",
  "number of municipalities and other local bodies. Das became the ",
  "Mayor  of  Calcutta  (with  Subhas  Bose  as  his  Chief  Executive ",
  "Officer),  and  Vithalbhai  Patel.  the  President  of  Bombay ",
  "Corporation,  Vallabhbhai  Patel  of  Ahmedabad  Municipality, ",
  "Rajendra Prasad of Patna Municipality, and Jawaharlal Nehru of ",
  "Allahabad Municipality. The no-changers actively joined in these ",
  "ventures since they believed that local bodies could be used to ",
  "promote the constructive programme.  ",
  "Despite  their  circumscribed  powers,  many  of  the ",
  "municipalities and district boards, headed by a galaxy of leaders, ",
  "set out to raise, however little, the quality of life of the people. ",
  "They  did  excellent  work  in  the  fields  of  education,  sanitation, ",
  "health,  ariti-untouchability,  and  khadi  promotion,  won  the ",
  "admiration  of  friend  and  foe,  and  quite  often  aroused  popular ",
  "enthusiasm. ",
  "The Swarajists suffered a major loss when C.R. Das died on ",
  "16  June  1925.  Even  more  serious  were  a  few  other  political ",
  "developments.  In  the  absence  of  a  mass  movement, ",
  "communalism raised its ugly head and the political frustrations ",
  "of the people began to find expression in communal riots. Actively ",
  "encouraged by the colonial authorities, the communalists of all ",
  "hues found a fertile field for their activities.  ",
  "Its  preoccupation  with  parliamentary  politics  also  started ",
  "telling on the internal cohesion of the Swaraj Party. For one, the ",
  "limits  of  politics  of  obstruction  were  soon  reached.  Having ",
  "repeatedly outvoted the  Government and forced  it to certify its ",
  "legislation,  there  was  no  way  of  going  further  inside  the ",
  "legislatures  and  escalating  the  politics  of  confrontation.  This ",
  "could  be  done  only  by  a  mass  movement  outside.  But  the ",
  "Swarajists lacked any policy of coordinating their militant work ",
  " 232 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "in the legislatures with mass political work outside. In fact, they ",
  "relied almost wholly on newspaper reporting.  ",
  "The Swarajists also could not carry their coalition partners ",
  "for ever and in every respect, for the latter did not believe in the ",
  "Swarajists\u2019  tactic  of  \u2018uniform,  continuous  and  consistent ",
  "obstruction.\u2019  The  logic  of  coalition  politics  soon  began  to  pull ",
  "back the  Swarajists  from militant obstructionism. Some  of the ",
  "Swarajist  legislators  could  also  not  resist  the  pulls  of ",
  "parliamentary perquisites and positions of status and patronage.  ",
  "The Government\u2019s policy of creating dissension among the ",
  "nationalists  by  trying  to  separate  the  Swarajists  from  the ",
  "Liberals, militant Swarajists from the more moderate Swarajists, ",
  "and  Hindus  from  Muslims  began  to  bear  fruit.  In  Bengal,  the ",
  "majority in the Swaraj Party failed to support the tenants\u2019 cause ",
  "against the zamindars and, thereby, lost the support of its pro-",
  "tenant,  mostly  Muslim,  members.  Nor  could  the  Swaraj  Party ",
  "avoid the intrusion of communal discord in its own ranks.  ",
  "Very soon, a group of Responsivists arose in the party who ",
  "wanted to work the reforms and to hold office wherever possible. ",
  "The  Responsivists  joined  the  Government  in  the  Central ",
  "Provinces. Their ranks were soon  swelled by N.C. Kelkar, M.R. ",
  "Jayakar  and  other  leaders.  Lajpat  Rai  and  Madan  Mohan ",
  "Malaviya  too  separated  themselves  from  the  Swaraj  Party  on ",
  "Responsivist as well as communal grounds.  ",
  "To  prevent  further  dissolution  and  disintegration  of  the ",
  "party,  the  spread  of  parliamentary  \u2018corruption,\u2019  and  further ",
  "weakening of the moral fibre of its members, the main leadership ",
  "of  the  party  reiterated  its  faith  in  mass  civil  disobedience  and ",
  "decided  to  withdraw  from  the  legislatures  in  March  1926. ",
  "Gandhiji, too, had resumed his critique of council-entry. He wrote ",
  "to Srinivasa Iyengar in April 1926: The more I study the Councils\u2019 ",
  "work, the effect of the entry into the Councils upon public life, its ",
  "repercussions  upon  the  Hindu-Muslim  question,  the  more ",
  "convinced I become not only of the futility but the inadvisability ",
  "of Council-entry.\u201d  ",

  "233 | The Years Of Stagnation \u2014 Swarajists, No-Changers And Gandhiji ",
  "The Swaraj Party went into the elections held in November ",
  "1926 as a party in disarray \u2014 a much weaker and demoralized ",
  "force. It had to face the Government and loyalist elements and its ",
  "own  dissenters  on  the  one  side  and  the  resurgent  Hindu  and ",
  "Muslim  communalists  on  the  other.  A  virulent  communal  and ",
  "unscrupulous  campaign  was  waged  against  the  Swarajists. ",
  "Motilal  Nehru  was,  for  example,  accused  of  sacrificing  Hindu ",
  "interests,  of  favouring  cow-slaughter,  and  of  eating  beef.  The ",
  "Muslim  communalists  were  no  less  active  in  branding  the ",
  "Swarajists as anti- Muslim. The result was a severe weakening of ",
  "the  Swaraj  Party.  It  succeeded  in  winning  forty  seats  at  the ",
  "centre and half the seats in Madras but was severely mauled in ",
  "all  other  provinces,  especially  in  U.P.,  C.P.,  and  Punjab. ",
  "Moreover, both Hindu and Muslim communalists increased their ",
  "representation  in  the  councils.  The  Swarajists  also  could  not ",
  "form a nationalist coalition in the legislatures as they had done ",
  "in 1923.  ",
  "Once again the Swarajists passed a series of adjournment ",
  "motions  and  defeated  the  Government  on  a  number  of  bills. ",
  "Noteworthy  was  the  defeat  of  the  Government  on  the  Public ",
  "Safety  Bill  in  1928.  Frightened  by  the  spread  of  socialist  and ",
  "communist ideas and influence and believing that the crucial role ",
  "in  this  respect  was  being  played  by  British  and  other  foreign ",
  "agitators  sent  to  India  by  the  Communist  International,  the ",
  "Government  proposed  to  acquire  the  power  to  deport ",
  "\u2018undesirable\u2019  and  \u2018subversive\u2019  foreigners.  Nationalists  of  all ",
  "colours, from the moderates to the militants, united in opposing ",
  "the Bill. Lala Lajpat Rai said, \u2018Capitalism is only another name ",
  "for  Imperialism  .  .  .  We  are  in  no  danger  from  Bolshevism  or ",
  "Communism.  The  greatest  danger  we  are  in,  is  from  the ",
  "capitalists  and  exploiters.\u201917  Motilal  Nehru  narrated  his ",
  "experiences  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  condemned  anti-Soviet ",
  "propaganda.  He  described  the  Public  Safety  Bill  as  \u2018a  direct ",
  "attack on Indian nationalism, on the Indian National Congress\u2019 ",
  "and as \u2018the Slavery of India, Bill No. 1.\u2019 T. Prakasam said that the ",
  "Bill\u2019s main aim was to prevent the spread of nationalism among ",
  "workers  and  peasants.\u2019  Diwan  Chaman  Lall,  then  a  firebrand ",
  "protege of Motilal, declared: \u2018If you are trying to preach against ",
  "socialism, if  you  are demanding  powers to  suppress socialism, ",
  "you will have to walk over our dead bodies before you can get ",
  "that  power.\u2019  Even  the  two  spokesmen  of  the  capitalist  class, ",
  " 234 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "Purshottamdas  Thakurdas  and  G.D.  Birla,  firmly  opposed  the ",
  "Bill.  ",
  "In  March  1929,  having  failed  to  get  the  Bill  passed,  the ",
  "Government  arrested  thirty-one  leading  communists,  trade ",
  "unionists  and  other  leftwing  leaders  and  put  them  on  trial  at ",
  "Meerut.  This  led  to  strong  criticism  of  the  Government  by  the ",
  "nationalists.  Describing  the  arrests  as  presaging  a  period  of ",
  "terrorism,\u2019  Gandhi  said  that  the  motive  behind  these ",
  "prosecutions is not to kill Communism, it is to strike terror.\u2019 He ",
  "added:  \u2018Evidently  it  (the  Government)  believes  in  a  periodical ",
  "exhibition of its capacity (supersede all law and to discover to a ",
  "trembling India the red claws which usually remain under cover.\u2019 ",
  "The Swarajists finally walked out of the legislatures in 1930 as a ",
  "result  of  the  Lahore  Congress  resolution  and  the  beginning  of ",
  "civil disobedience.  ",
  "Their great achievement lay in their filling the political void ",
  "at  a  time  when  the  national  movement  was  recouping  its ",
  "strength.  And  this  they  did  without  getting  co-opted  by  the ",
  "colonial  regime.  As  Motilal  Nehru  wrote  to  his  son:  \u2018We  have ",
  "stood firm.\u2019 While some in their ranks fell by the wayside as was ",
  "inevitable  in  the  parliamentary  framework,  the  overwhelming ",
  "majority proved their mettle and stood their ground. They worked ",
  "in the legislatures in an orderly disciplined manner and withdrew ",
  "from them whenever the call came. Above all, they showed that it ",
  "was possible to use the legislatures in a creative manner even as ",
  "they promoted the politics of self-reliant anti-imperialism. They ",
  "also  successfully  exposed  the  hollowness  of  the  Reform  Act  of ",
  "1919  and  showed  the  people  that  India  was  being  ruled  by  \u2018 ",
  "lawIess laws.  ",
  "* ",
  "In  the  meantime,  the  no-changers  carried  on  laborious, ",
  "quiet,  undemonstrative,  grass-roots  constructive  work  around ",
  "the  promotion  of  khadi  and  spinning,  national  education  and ",
  "Hindu-Muslim unity, the struggle against untouchability and the ",
  "boycott of foreign cloth. This work was symbolized by hundreds ",
  "of  ashrams  that  came  up  all  over  the  country  where  political ",
  "cadres got practical training in khadi work and work among the ",
  "lower castes and tribal people. For example, there was the Vedchi  ",
  "235 | The Years Of Stagnation \u2014 Swarajists, No-Changers And Gandhiji ",
  "Ashram  in  Bardoli  taluqa,  Gujarat,  where  Chimanlal  Mehta, ",
  "Jugatram Dave and Chimanlal Bhatt devoted their entire lives to ",
  "the spread of education among the adivasis or kaliparaj; or the ",
  "work  done  by  Ravishankar  Maharaj  among  the  lower  caste ",
  "Baralyas of Kheda district.  ",
  "In fact, Gandhian constructive work was multi-faceted in its ",
  "content.  It  brought  some  much-needed  relief  to  the  poor,  it ",
  "promoted the process of the nation-in-the-making; and it made ",
  "the  urban-based  and  upper  caste  cadres  familiar  with  the ",
  "conditions  of  villages  and  lower  castes.  It  provided  Congress ",
  "political workers or cadres Continuous and effective work in the ",
  "passive  phases  of  the  national  movement,  helped  build  their ",
  "bonds  with  those  sections  of  the  masses  who  were  hitherto ",
  "untouched  by  politics,  and  developed  their  organizing  capacity ",
  "and self-reliance. It filled the rural masses with a new hope and ",
  "increased Congress influence among them.  ",
  "Without  the  uplift  of  the  lower  castes  and  Adivasis  there ",
  "could be no united struggle against colonialism. The boycott of ",
  "foreign cloth was a stroke of genius which demonstrated to rulers ",
  "and  the  world  the  Indian  people\u2019s  determination  to  be  free. ",
  "National  schools  and  colleges  trained  young  men  in  an ",
  "alternative, non-colonial ideological framework. A large number of ",
  "young men and women who dropped out in 1920-21 went back ",
  "to  the  officially  recognized  educational  institutions  but  many ",
  "often became whole time cadres of the movement.  ",
  "As a whole, constructive work was a major channel for the ",
  "recruitment of the soldiers of freedom and their political training ",
  "\u2014  as  also  for  the  choosing  and  testing  of  their  \u2018officers\u2019  and ",
  "leaders. Constructive workers were to act as the steelframe of the ",
  "nationalist  movement  in  its  active  Satyagraha  phase.  It  was, ",
  "therefore, not accidental that khadi bhandar workers, students ",
  "and  teachers  of  national  schools  and  colleges,  and  Gandhian ",
  "ashrams\u2019  inmates  served  as  the  backbone  of  the  civil ",
  "disobedience  movements  both  as  organizers  and  as  active ",
  "Satyagrahis.  ",
  "The  years  1922-27  were  a  period  of  contradictory ",
  "developments. While the Swarajists and Gandhian constructive ",
  "workers  were  quite  active  in  their  own  separate  ways,  there ",
  "simultaneously prevailed virulent factionalism and indiscipline in ",
  " 236 | India\u2019s Struggle For Independence ",
  "both the camps. By 1927, on the whole, an atmosphere of apathy ",
  "and  frustration  had  begun  to  prevail.  Gandhiji  wrote  in  May ",
  "1927:  \u2018My  only  hope  therefore  lies  in  prayer  and  answer  to ",
  "prayer.\u2019 ",
  "But  underneath,  after  years  of  rest  and  recoupment,  the ",
  "forces of nationalism were again getting ready to enter a period of ",
  "active struggle. This became evident in the rise of youth power ",
  "and the national response to the Simon Commission.  237 | Bhagat Singh, Surya Sen and the Revolutionary Terrorists ",
