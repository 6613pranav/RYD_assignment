  "ECONOMIC REFORMS",
  "40.1 ECONOMIC REFORMS ENCAPSULATED",
  "We had seen India in three different perspectives: first\u2014domestic, second\u2014external and ",
  "third\u2014global perspective. There is a need to integrate all the perspectives to see the Indian ",
  "outlook in view of the rapidly changing global environment, into the future, tasks ahead ",

  "As we had discussed the global transition, post-independence, the economic reforms ",
  "of 1991 can be said to be transition towards a newer India, shift in the outlook and a ",
  "different  orientation  from  the  previous  inward-looking  to  outward-looking.  It  is  also  a ",
  "reflection of the mood of the government of greater faith in the market and private players ",
  "and their larger role in the economy. Here, an attempt is being made to provide a holistic ",
  "and comprehensive review of the economic reforms initiated since 1991.",
  "Even though it is widely believed that 1991 was the beginning of reforms in India, ",
  "reforms dare back to previous years. However, these were piece meal, specific and micro\u00ad",
  "oriented and were witnessed more as changes\u2019 rather than reforms. The policy of 1991 ",
  "marked the character of changes\u2019 changing to \u2018reforms\u2019, reflecting a distinct priority and ",
  "documented as a policy not done earlier.",
  "The other aspect of the reform is that they were largely initiated by the BOP crisis, ",

  "                         ",
  "Though reforms are generic but governments for their own understanding prefer to use",
  "                   ",
  "terminologies \u2018first-and-second generation reforms\u2019. First generation reforms are the first",
  "                       ",
  "level, central government-driven, directed at addressing the cause of the crisis, structural",
  "                         ",
  "rigidities in different product markets such as industrial, trade and financial sectors of",

  "The  additional  reforms  conceived  and  implemented  to  achieve  a  faster  growth ",
  "rate  and  address  other  economic  problems  of  poverty,  unemployment,  etc.,  are  called ",
  "\u2018Second Generation Reforms\u2019. These reforms run deeper into the economy beyond the ",
  "product markets, requiring involvement of the state governments and broad level consensus ",
  "across political parties. These are also time-consuming as they may require amendments ",
  "and changes in many legislations and various acts. The second generation reforms are ",
  "development  driven.  They  aim  at  achieving  faster  economic  development.  They  are ",
  "the  lasting  solution  of various economic ills affecting India\u2019s economy in the shortest ",
  "possible  time.  The  pinpointed  focus  of  second  generation  reforms  are  on  the  below ",
  "mentioned areas:",
  "\u25a1  Policies to remove poverty and empowerment of the poor and weaker sections of ",
  "society.",
  "\u25a1  Policies  to  enhance  employment  opportunities  and  social  security  for  the  poor ",
  "people.",
  "\u25a1  Social  sector  reforms  to  strengthen  social  infrastructure  such  as  development  of ",
  "knowledge,  skills,  efficiency  through  increased  emphasis  on  eduction,  health  and ",
  "housing facilities, improvement in water supply and sanitation, etc.",
  "\u25a1  Further fiscal consolidation, reduction in fiscal deficit through increased tax and ",
  "non-tax  revenues  and  reduction  in  expenditure  by  minimizing  unproductive ",
  "expenditure and cutting down subsidies.",
  "\u25a1  Reducing fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP for the Central Government and 2 ",
  "per cent for states.",
  "\u25a1  Achieving zero revenue deficit.",
  "\u25a1  Raising  capital  expenditure  on  rural  infrastructure  with  a  view  to  stimulating ",
  "agricultural growth and rural development.",
  "\u25a1  Continuing  and  carrying  forward  programme  of  disinvestment  of  loss-making ",
  "public sector enterprises.",
  "\u25a1  Abolishing  subsidies  on  all  non-merit  goods  and  eliminate  hidden  subsidies ",
  "benefiting better off sections of society.",
  "\u25a1  Reforming labour laws.",
  "The main distinction between the two lies in their priority and ability to implement ",
  "and  deliver  with ease. They are not sequential and can be undertaken simultaneously. ",
  "It depends on how critical they are and the general levels of acceptability within the ",
  "government and the political system.",
  "40.3 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC REFORMS IN INDIA",
  "Most of the reforms in India since 1991 are broadly first-generation reforms, across various ",
  "sectors, except some which could be characterized as second-generation, but more focused ",
  "on  first-generation  reforms.  They  have  been  central  government-driven  in  their  area ",
  "of domain. They have been discussed sector-wise in the previous sections, but are being ",
  "revisited, co facilitate a greater cohesive comprehension.",
  "Industrial sector reforms are as follows:",
  "(1)  The industrial policy of 1991 also known as the policy of liberalization marked the ",
  "dismantling of the industrial licensing system, larger role for the private sector and",
  "move towardsa competitive environment.TWO DECADES OF ECONOMIC REFORMS\u2014INDI A 345",

  "industries .  ",
  "(3)  (here has been diversification of the industrial base with a large number of industrial ",
  "goods being produced.",
  "(4)  The  public  and  private  sector  are  now  operating  in  a  competitive  environment ",
  "bringing out the mixed economy character very clearly.",
  "(5)  The private sector post-reforms have helped to increase the industrial growth and ",
  "lifted the overall plane of economic growth.",
  "(6)  The  private  sector  has  gone  aggressively  for  global  acquisitions  helping  them  to ",
  "emerge as global players in the international market. For example, Tata-Corus Jaguar, ",
  "TCS, Videocon, ONGC, etc.",
  "(7)  Public sector also has been given greater autonomy for operational flexibility in the ",
  "competitive environment.",
  "It has led to establishing India as a market economy with pricing of most industrial ",
  "goods as market-determined, except for certain petro goods.",
  "The increased production of private sector and their growth in the last two decades has ",
  "been impressive leading to higher growth and also increased overall investments in the ",
  "economy which will make a 10 per cent overall growth, a reality, in the not too distant ",
  "future.",
  "Financial Sector Reforms",
  "The financial sector reforms in the banking sector was largely driven by the \u2018Narasimham ",
  "Committee\u2019 recommendations which allowed for liberal entry of private and foreign banks ",
  "letting for greater competition, diversified products and vastly improved services. Major areas ",
  "of reform in the banking sector were as follows:",
  "(1)  Liberal entry of private sector and foreign banks. It is as part of the reforms that today ",
  "there arc also private sector banks operating along with the public sector banks.",
  "(2)  Public sector was given greater autonomy to function in a competitive environment ",
  "and frame-independent policies based on broad framework provided by RBI.",
  "(3)  Interest rates both the deposits as well as advances were deregulated and each bank ",
  "was free to decide on the interest rates it chose to offer.",
  "(4)  Similarly, in respect of lending rates while banks were free to decide on the interest ",
  "rate they would charge, they had to publish the lowest rate of interest. They would ",
  "charge to their best clients known as the benchmarked prime lending rate (BPLR).",
  "More recently during 2010, RBI has asked the banks to adopt the base rate of ",
  "interest, and that no lending would be done by banks below their respective published ",
  "base rate of interest.",
  "(5)  Banking was made more transparent, stress on full disclosure of both the good as well ",
  "as bad assets.",
  "(6)  There was standardization and uniform income recognition, asset classification and ",
  "provisioning norms for the banking sector.",
  "For the first time, a uniform definition was given to non-performing assets (NPAs) ",
  "known as the 90 days norms. Thus, interest on loans given if not received within the ",
  "stipulated time period would need to be classified as an NPA.346 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(7)  Realizing  that  banking  is  risky  business  having  normal  risks  in  lending  and  to ",
  "safeguard interest banks were required to adhere to \u2018capital adequacy\u2019 norms in terms ",
  "of international best practices (more about this later in this section).",
  "The overall objective was to bring in greater competition in the banking sector by allowing ",
  "for  better  products  and  improved  services  and  fine-tuned  interest  rates  to  support  the ",
  "financial needs of a growing economy like India and enable bigger banks in India to ",
  "emerge as global banks. Insurance-sector reforms were driven by the \u2018Malhotra Committee\u2019 ",
  "recommendations  which,  for  the  first  time  opened  the  insurance  sector,  even  though ",
  "partially, to the private sector, from the complete government-dominated insurance sector.",
  "The  insurance  sector  has  been  opened  up  100  per  cent  for  the  private  sector  but ",
  "restricted to 26 per cent equity participation for foreign insurance companies. Post-reforms ",
  "a large number of insurance companies in the private sector have become operational in ",
  "the country.",
  "Tax Reforms",
  "One of the major aspects of reforms has been in the areas of taxation of moving to a ",
  "Value-added Tax (VAT) system and conversion of the sales tax regime into homogenized ",
  "state VAT. A still far ambitious reform which will provide for an efficient indirect tax ",
  "regime is moving to a uniform goods and services tax (GST). Similarly, the direct tax code ",
  "once made operational would considerably simplify the direct tax system providing for far ",
  "greater tax compliance.",
  "Trade Sector Reforms",
  "However, the most profound impact has been through the trade sector reforms, an integral ",
  "part of economic reforms much wider in nature.",
  "(a)  These reforms has given the clear signal of opening the economy and larger role for ",
  "exports, capital flows and a competitive, efficient and productive domestic economy.",
  "(b)  More specifically, reforms covered moving towards a market-determined exchange",
  "rate,  replacing  FERA  with  FEMA,  current  account  convertibility  and  fairly  open ",
  "capital account and liberalized external commercial borrowings by the private sector.",
  "(c)  It also liberalized the foreign investment policy to attract foreign investment and ",
  "eased restrictions on capital inflows.",
  "(d)  These measures have been largely responsible for increasing exports and increased ",
  "share in global trade of goods and services.",
  "(e)  The external transactions arc now over 100 per cent of the GDP, built-up foreign ",
  "exchange reserves providing an import cover of over 7 months as against barely seven ",
  "days during 1991.",
  "However, the most notable aspect of reforms has been the fact, that not only India got ",
  "out of the crisis, not only repaid but prepaid its liabilities to the IMF and has turned as ",
  "a \u2018lender from a borrower\u2019 to the IMF. It has earned the status of an emerging economy, ",
  "changed the global perspective of India and now having a larger say in global matters. It TWO DECADES OF ECONOMIC REFORMS\u2014INDI A 347",
  "has emerged as the second fastest growing economy of the world after China, in a short ",
  "time of just about two decades.",
  "Labour Reforms.",
  "Along with bringing transparency and accountability in enforcement of Labour Laws, the ",
  "Government has taken various initiatives to realize and establish the dignity of every worker ",
  "through provision of social security, enhancing the avenues and quality of employment ",
  "along with industrial development. Recent major reforms are:",
  "Introduction  of  Labour  Codes:  In  line  with  recommendations  of  Second  National ",
  "Commission on Labour, the Government has taken steps for formulating of four Labour ",
  "Codes on (i) Wages; (ii) Industrial Relations; (iii) Social Security & Welfare; and (iv) ",
  "Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions by amalgamating, simplifying, and ",
  "rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws.",
  "Launching of Shram Suvidha Portal: The Government has developed a unified Web ",
  "Portal \u2018Shram Suvidha Portal\u2019, to bring transparency and accountability in enforcement of ",
  "labour laws and ease complexity of compliance.",

  "2017: Increased paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and has benefited 18 ",

  "March, 2018 and by the Rajya Sabha on 22nd March, 2018, has been brought in force on ",
  "29th March, 2018. The present upper ceiling on gratuity amount under the Act has been ",
  "raised from Rs. 10 Lakh, to Rs. 20 Lakhs.",
  "Atal  BimitVyakti  Kalyan  Yojana:  Considering  the  change  in  employment  pattern ",
  "and  the  current  scenario  of  employment  in  India  which  has  transformed  from  a  long ",

  "Where the Economic Reforms Have Not Delivered?",
  "What we have just covered is the positive side of the reforms, however, it also has shades ",
  "of grey areas which is a matter of concern.348 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(1)  The overall growth even though higher from the past and also in relation to other ",
  "economies, has been fairly uneven, or exclusive but not inclusive.",
  "(2)  The benefits of growth have been confined to few not broad-based to benefit the ",
  "masses.",
  "(3)  It is not led to the desired degree of expansion in employment opportunities, normally ",
  "associated with, high levels of growth. Employment in the manufacturing sector has ",
  "stagnated.",
  "(4)  The  growth  has  been  highly  skewed,  accentuating  inter-state  and  intra-state ",
  "inequalities. It has virtually left the (Bihar, MP, Assam, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh) ",
  "states untouched.",
  "(5)  The  \u2018license  Raj\u2019  has  been  abolished  but  replaced  by  a  bigger  hindrance  of  the ",
  "\u2018inspector Raj\u2019.",
  "(6)  Bureaucratic control has solely changed its face has moved from direct to indirect ",
  "such as pollution control boards, environmental clearances, etc.",
  "(7) Levy and collection of excise duties is still complex.",
  "(8) The earlier nexus between the politics and business, despite the reform process, has",
  "only go tstronger.",
  "The above has not happened essentially because the government has virtually pressed ",
  "the \u2018pause\u2019 button of economic reforms with a large unfinished agenda of:",
  "(1)  The government could be said to have gone \u2018soft\u2019 on bolder reforms. Labour market ",
  "reform,  which  is  not  even  being  considered  by  the  government,  despite  it  being ",
  "fundamental,  in  the  changed  circumstances  and  to  provide  the  much  needed  link ",
  "between growth and employment opportunities.",
  "(2)  Further, unshackling the private sector from the myriads of indirect interface with ",
  "the government.",
  "(3)  Bringing on board the state governments to share the passion of driving the reforms ",
  "deeper across states.",
  "(4)  Pushing through to make the NCLT functional at the earliest as it is one of the ",
  "components of an exit policy, seen as a facilitator to the process of liberalization.",
  "(5)  Privatization has virtually been put on the back burner with only disinvestment in ",
  "public sector being considered. This is a retrograde step and at least a platform should ",
  "be created for building a broad-based consensus.",
  "(6)  Loss-making public sector continues to act as a drain and no efforts made to see how ",
  "they can be integrated in a liberalized market economy.",
  "(7)  The banking sector despite reforms is largely dominated by the public sector and no ",
  "efforts at their consolidation or privatization for their long-term sustainability.",
  "(8)  Efforts at reforms in the insurance sector have been half-hearted, with the dominance ",
  "of the government, despite the fact that insurance in market is fairly under developed ",
  "and lacking penetration.",
  "(9)  The FDI policy still has a number of structural issues and potential road blocks ",
  "to  foreign  investment.  FDI  in  organized  retail,  raising  sectoral  caps  for  insurance ",
  "business by foreign companies are key aspects of reforms.TWO DECADES OF ECONOMIC REFORMS\u2014INDI A 349",
  "40.4 UNFINISHED AGENDA OF ECONOMIC REFORMS",
  "The  government  has  a  fairly  long  list  of  the  unfinished  agenda  in  economic  reforms, ",
  "which is not presently considered as a priority but would become critical in driving the ",
  "reforms not only deeper but sustainable in the future as the economy steps into the global ",
  "environment. It has political compulsions in a democratic framework and gets limited by ",
  "the lack of consensus on many bolder reforms.",
  "It is not to say that it should coercively drive bolder reforms, but at least do those ",
  "which fall in its domain, less controversial, and for the bolder reforms, flag them, create ",
  "appropriate platforms for discussions and over a period of time, with consensus implement ",
  "them.  At  a  still  broader  level,  reforms  other  than  economic  also  influence  economies ",
  "such as police, judicial, bureaucracy and many such smaller reforms can have a profound ",
  "impact, by spreading positive sentiments of growth and welfare in the economy.",
  "It  can  be  said,  all  these  reforms  economic  or  otherwise  are  centred  \u2018around\u2019  the ",
  "government but what about the government itself? It is also a candidate for reform itself. ",
  "The  speed  of  decision-making,  better  inter-ministerial  coordination,  leaner  government ",
  "structure, technology-enabled, proactive and not reactive character, are all relatively simple ",
  "to implement and send positive signals in the economy.",
  "It is in these, not able to implement 1000 of smaller reforms, it can be said that reforms ",
  "in India have slowed down, if not paused by the government and not because of its in ",
  "ability to push through bolder norms. It is not the ability to push bolder reforms which is ",
  "being questioned, but as mentioned previously, in their ability to flag them and provide a ",
  "platform for a broad-based consensus, which is being questioned. The other is government\u00ad",
  "reforming itself, which is relatively easy but still difficult requires a strong will and still ",
  "more important a decisive discipline and a consciousness of their larger responsibilities ",
  "towards the national interests rather than party interests.",
  "40.5 BIG BANG ECONOMIC REFORMS CENTRED",
  "AT ECONOMIC GROWTH",
  "During 2014, after the UPA-government historic mandate Narendra Modi, took over as ",
  "India\u2019s Prime Minister with the promise of good days (achhe din) for all. India\u2019s agenda ",
  "on the so-called big bang economic reforms were listed and discussed across forums from ",
  "day 1 of the Modi-government. These were categorized as GST, land acquisition, labour, ",
  "banking, investment liberalization and subsidy reforms.",
  "During last two years the government is right on track of reforms front not through ",
  "big bang reforms, but several small, baby-steps. Most notably, the government has set ",
  "economic wheel in motion by kicking off the process in the area of subsidy reforms. It ",
  "has done so by promoting Aadhaar-bank account linkage for the roll out of Direct Benefit ",
  "Transfer (DBT). The LPG subsidy roll our through DBT was indeed a great move by ",
  "this government to curtail leakage and diversion of government funds\u2014something that ",
  "distorted the system for long.",
  "In  the  next  three  years,  the  government  should  enhance  the  reform  task  to  food, ",
  "fertilizer and other government benefits to the poor. The passage of Aadhaar Bill is a great ",
  "enabler. The whole subsidy reforms process, which was first kicked off by the UPA-regime, ",
  "is  built  on  the  DBT  channel,  based  on  the  unique  identity  number,  or  Aadhaar  card 350 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "provided to each citizen. It holds particular importance for the current government, and ",
  "the success of its financial inclusion push under the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile) ",
  "trinity. With 99.21 crore Aadhaar cards already been issued to almost 97 percent of the ",
  "country\u2019s adult population, taking ahead the subsidy reforms process using this channel is ",
  "a logical step for India.",
  "Liberalization  of  Foreign  Direct  Investment  (FDI)  norms  and  \u2018Modi  shows\u2019  in ",
  "numerous foreign trips, have led to the spike in inward fund flows. The FDI inflows has ",
  "grown by 29% to USD 40 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2016. But, the absence ",
  "of revival in private investment cycle is still acting as a drag on the economy on multiple ",
  "fronts. New projects are yet to happen in a major way and the existing stock of stalled ",
  "projects continues to be a pain.. The chunk of stalled projects has gone up to Rs 11.4 lakh ",
  "crore in the fourth quartero ff iscaly ear2 016.",
  "The absence of fresh private investments  becomes  even a greater problem  seen in the ",
  "backdrop of bank funding drying up to industries.H ugeN PAson  bank balanceshee tshave ",

  "When it comes to banking sector reforms, the passage of the bankruptcy law is a major ",
  "step in the process of overhauling the country\u2019s Rs 101 lakh crorc banking sector, even ",
  "though implementation is key. Bankruptcy code passage also helped the UPA government ",
  "to break the reforms jinx in successive parliament sessions battered by controversies and ",
  "political blame games.",
  "The reforms task is half-done yet. If the ongoing spike in bank NPAs continue for ",
  "another few quarters, state-run banks will face a crisis situation if the government fails ",
  "to bail out these entities. Averting a banking sector crisis will be one of the key tasks that ",
  "will be used to judge the finished agenda in economic reforms. The Reserve Bank of India ",
  "(RBI) beginning the clean-up exercise has shown the actual depth of the trouble on the ",
  "books of Indian banks (hidden bad loans), especially state-run lenders.",
  "In the March-quarter, PSU banks have reported record level of bad Ioans resulting ",
  "in cumulative losses of over Rs 14,000 crore in the quarter. While the clean-up exercise ",
  "should be done sooner than later. A crisis in the banking sector can upset the calculations. ",
  "In the long-term, the biggest reform banking sector need is privatisation since government ",
  "cannot keep on feeding banks. So, it is high time now to undertake radical reform measures ",
  "in the banking industry.",
  "The issue of land reforms is more or less off the table now. Since land acquisition is more ",
  "or less is a state-specific affair now, there isn\u2019t much the central government can do about.",
  "The  government  has  taken  up  a  catalytic  reform  agenda  across  multiple  domains ",
  "since assuming charge whether it is legislative as in the Bankruptcy Act, procedural as in ",
  "direct benefits transfer, or systemic like transparent auction of resources. The power sector ",
  "reforms for coal supply, financial health of discoms under the UDAY scheme and bold ",
  "innovative GST as biggest tax reform, thereby fulfilled the promise to significantly push ",
  "up the GDP by 1.5%-2% going ahead.",
