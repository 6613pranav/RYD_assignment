  "and 2100 kc alorie sperperson perday  in u rban areas .",
  "The World Bank has coined its own universal definition of poverty levels as per person ",
  "consumption of less than US $1 per day.",
  "Relative  poverty,  is across  difference  in income levels of the rich and the relative ",
  "poor. Even by this crude definition of Planning Commission of absolute poverty, it is ",
  "estimated that over 230 million people are living below poverty line (BPL). According to ",
  "the definition of World Bank, the numbers would increase significantly. India is said to ",
  "have the largest number of people living BPL. The number of people BPL is even more ",
  "higher than the entire population of the US. Poverty is largely concentrated in states such ",
  "as UP, Bihar, Orissa, MP, West Bengal and they account for over 50 per cent of the total ",
  "poverty in India.",
  "Despite  over  six  decades  of  independence,  why  poverty  continues  to  exist?  It  can ",
  "be  attributed to  the large  economic  dependence  on the  agricultural sector, subsistence, ",
  "traditional  and  stagnating,  which  are  not  able  to  provide  enough  for  the  dependent ",
  "population  in  terms  of  employment  opportunities,  high  levels  of  adult  illiteracy,  large ",
  "number of landless, small and marginal farmers with no income support. There is absence ",
  "of employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector.",
  "It is not about how poverty is measured crude or refined? It is the biggest curse of post\u00ad",
  "independence India of not being able to address the large-scale poverty in the country despite ",
  "the well-intended schemes as can be seen in the following sections.",
  "SOCIAL SECTOR",
  "Social sector and poverty are interrelated as it largely comprises of those BPL and also ",
  "that segment of the population which is outside the mainstream of development, which ",
  "consists of the under-privileged, always at the receiving end, poor, backward classes and ",
  "scheduled castes/tribes. It will also have landless, small and marginal farmers who are 26 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "engaged in casual work in the informal sector, living virtually on a daily basis. They are ",
  "the most vulnerable section prone to exploitation, domination and do not have any voice ",
  "or can also be known as \u2018silent sufferers\u2019 or a \u2018mere spectator\u2019 to their pitiable and pathetic ",
  "condition oblivious of the fact that India is today one of the fastest growing economies.",
  "One has already seen earlier, why this has happened. But what has the Government ",
  "done about this? It has adopted a three-pronged strategy to address the social sectors which ",
  "are as follows:",
  "1.Broad Targeting ;",
  "   ",
  "  2.NarrowTargeting;",
  " ",
  "3.SocialSecurity.",
  "Broad Targeting",
  "Under  broad  targeting  strategies  the  government  undertakes  ambitious  programs  with ",
  "sub-programes for overall and comprehensive development of the country. Example of the ",
  "broad targeting programmes are:",
  "1. Indira Awas Yojana",
  "2.SarvaSik shaAb hiyan",

  "   ",
  "9.Rajiv GandhiDrinking WaterScheme.",
  "Of  all  the  above,  the  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee ",
  "Scheme (MGNREGA) is the most ambitious project of the government which is being ",
  "implemented at the national level and of magnitude not seen anywhere in the world. It is ",
  "the brain child of Jean Dreze, a Belgian economist. This scheme has now been enacted and ",
  "guarantees unskilled wage employment of 100 days to one person in every rural household ",
  "at a minimum wage. The 100 days employment under this scheme is visualized in the lean ",
  "season of agricultural activities. This scheme is being implemented in all the districts of ",
  "the country and is seen as a major step in creating the employment opportunities and also ",
  "for poverty alleviation in the country. Women are given preference for employment under ",
  "this  scheme,  which  has  no  middlemen  or  contractor  and  directly  being  implemented ",
  "by the Gram Panchayats and the wages are paid in the bank account of those who are ",
  "provided with the employment. The state governments are required to give unemployment ",
  "allowance of one-third of the wages if not able to provide employment within 15 days of ",
  "their registration. This scheme has been globally lauded as one of the most well intended ",
  "schemes for the social sector anywhere in the world.",
  "Critics of the scheme, however, feel that such a scheme could be damaging in the long ",
  "run by pushing up the minimum wages and increase cost in the agricultural as well as POVERTY AND SOCIAL SECTOR 27",

  "fuelling inflation.",
  "Narrow Targeting",

  "and diagnostics, creating health and wellness centres (HWCs) to reinvigorate the failing ",

  "\u2022  It is a campaign of the Government of India that aims to generate awareness and ",
  "improve the efficiency of welfare services intended for girls. The scheme was launched ",
  "with an initial funding of  \u20b9 100 crore.",

  "awareness about the criticality of the issue.",
  "\u2022  The Scheme will have focused intervention & multi-sectoral action in 100 districts ",
  "with low Child Sex Ratio.",
  "Why has the plethora of schemes not yielded the desired results? A few reasons for ",
  "their failure are as follows:",
  "\u2022  The Government has well-designed schemes. The question is not about intention but ",
  "that of implementation of these schemes. There was not a proper identification of the ",
  "targeted beneficiaries.",
  "\u2022  There is also a lack of awareness of these schemes amongst the masses, given their ",
  "illiteracy and ignorance.",
  "\u2022  'There is also an absence of any monitoring mechanism for the efficacy of such schemes ",
  "or to know the end result. The focus is on increased outlays and new schemes but ",
  "there is no mechanism of tracking down the outcome.",
  "\u2022  It  may  be  better  to  implement  these  programmes  through  NGOs  after  a  strict ",
  "screening process and also with proper checks and balances in place.",
  "\u2022  There is a need to bring in an independent \u2018social audit\u2019 of these schemes not for ",
  "fixing accountability but for plugging leakages, improving delivery so as to make the ",
  "schemes effective and true to their intention for the overall benefit of the social sector.",
  "\u2022  Today,  there  is  an  availability  of  modern  technology  which  can  be  deployed ",
  "for  capturing  information  and  creating  a  database  which  will  enable  a  tracking ",
  "mechanism for the target group and their reach and will be useful in refining the ",
  "schemes in future.",
  "\u2022  Finally, the focus of the government has been on schemes, so many that they overlap ",
  "with diffused focus and accountability at different levels.",
  "The aspect of changing the orientation from schemes to the people in the villages could ",
  "be a better strategy and it also leads to convergence of all the schemes. This could be done ",
  "following the cluster approach\u2019 which is implementing all the schemes starting from the ",
  "most backward villages, bunched together as a cluster, for the schemes to be implemented 34 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "and ensuring their sustainability by transferring the onus of further development to the ",
  "villages and then moving to another cluster.",
  "It would be the responsibility of the state government to monitor the functioning of ",
  "the cluster of villages that are assisted through the schemes. This would provide for better ",
  "delivery of schemes, proper monitoring and also for sustainability of the efforts and will ",
  "lead to fundamental changes as the needs of the villages would get assessed first and not ",
  "the other way around. It will also enable the government to acquire an understanding ",
  "of the resources required and then the government could look at various alternatives of ",
  "implementing them.",
  "Right  since  Independence,  these  problems  have  persisted.  It  has  also  engaged  the ",
  "attention of successive governments but it has always been through increased outlays and ",
  "new schemes which have been launched for them, year after year, but without tangible ",
  "benefits.  What  is  now  required  is  to  tackle  them  differently.  A  few  suggestions  have ",
  "been provided earlier, not that they are bound to succeed, but will display the attitude ",
  "of the government of willing to experiment to find long-lasting solutions to the vexed ",
  "problems. The government has to keep in mind that it is not the resources which matter ",

  "4.3 MICRO FINANCE",

  "also given their extensive paper work, cumbersome procedures, documentation requirement, ",
  "the micro credit institutions are today seen as offering a solution both for the social sector as ",
  "well as addressing the issues of poverty. These institutions, as a concept have their genesis in ",
  "Bangladesh, pioneered by Mohammed Yunus, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize, as ",
  "successful institutions for reaching out to the last unit of any economy not possible through ",
  "banks and directly contributing to the uplift of the poor especially rural women.",
  "In India, the SHG movement started in 1992 under NABARD and with involvement ",
  "of banks. Under the SHG scheme credit is linked to savings by focusing on capacity ",
  "building,  with  low  interest  rates  usually  8-10  per  cent  with  monthly  repayment  but ",
  "responsibility  of  the  group  and  not  individuals.  SHGs  in  India  cover  90  million  poor ",
  "households and have extended credit ofo ver\u20b9  2 5,000 crore.",
  "Micro  Finance  Institutions  (MFIs)  are  institutions  which  provide  credit  to  the  poor ",
  "but at a high interest rate but lower than that charged by the money lenders. MFIs in ",
  "India have engaged the attention of the government only since 2003 and in the last 7 ",

  "employmentand also getoutofpoverty.POVERTY AND SOCIAL SECTOR 35",
  "However,  in  recent  times,  MFIs  especially  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  have  given  a  new ",
  "dimension and raised the following fundamental issues:",
  "1) Their prime motive is to earn profits through high profit margins by charging high ",
  "interest rates but slightly lower than that charged by the money lenders.",
  "(2)  MFIs have reached out to those ignored by the banks and also the fact they are not ",
  "complementing the efforts of the banks. There is sizeable concentration of MFIs in ",
  "areas where there is banking penetration.",
  "(3)  MFIs  are  finding  softer  options  of  lending  like  SHGs,  which  leads  to  multiple ",
  "financing, debt burden on the borrowers.",
  "(4)  MFI are aggressive and are more consumer-oriented loans, less productive-oriented, ",
  "similar like a private bank selling consumer loans or the US banks\u2019 lending to sub\u00ad",
  "prime borrowers.",
  "These developments have forced the government to rethink on this model of financial ",
  "inclusion and adding in place regulations for the MFI.",
  "However, at a broader level and to provide greater inclusivity the nationalized banks ",
  "are  better  placed  than  the  MFIs  through  innovative  means  such  as  the  correspondent ",
  "banking  route,  which  will  keep  costs  low  of  reaching out  without  the need  for  more ",
  "branches. Micro finance through MFIs would thus require a redesign but their greater ",
  "complementary and compatibility role with the banks would have to be explored to make ",
  "them as effective institutions of micro finance in India.",
  "Social  sector  is  one  of  the  key  sectors  of  the  economy  and  reaching  out  to  them ",
  "and drawing them into mainstream of development is the biggest responsibility of the ",

  "Ingredients of JAM",
  "           ",
  "TheessentialcomponentsforJAMarelisted below:",
  "               ",
  "1. Government \u2014\u00bb  Beneficiary: the challenge of identification: To  identify  the",
  "               ",
  "beneficiaries, the government needs databases of eligible individuals. Beneficiary ",
  "             ",
  "databases have existed for long before Aadhaar, but their accuracy and legitimacy ",
  "       ",
  "have been  hampered  by  the administrative and  political discretion  involved  in ",
  "               ",
  "granting identity proofs like BPL cards, driving licenses and voter IDs. Ghost and ",
  "                 ",
  "duplicate names crept into beneficiary lists, leading to leakage. Aadhaar s virtue lies",
  "           ",
  "in using technology to replace human discretion, while keeping the system simple",

  "After identifying  beneficiaries, the government must transfer money  to  them, for",

  "eased by the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, under which 120 million accounts",

  "UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME",
  "\"Wiping every tear from every eye\u201d based on the principles of universality, unconditionality, ",
  "and agency is the hallmarks of a Universal Basic Income (UBI). A number of implementation ",
  "challenges lie ahead, especially the risk that UBI would become an add-on to, rather than ",
  "a replacement of, current anti-poverty and social programs, which would make it fiscally ",
  "unaffordable. But given their multiplicity, costs, and questionable effectiveness, and the ",
  "real opportunities afforded by the rapidly improving \u201cJAM\u201d infrastructure, UBI holds the ",
  "prospects of improving upon the status quo.",
  "Introduction",
  "Despite  making  remarkable  progress  in  bringing  down  poverty  from  about  70  percent ",
  "at  independence  to  about  22  percent  in  2011-12  (Tendulkar  Committee), it can safely ",
  "be said that \u201cwiping every tear from every eye\u201d is about a lot more than being able to ",
  "imbibe  a  few  calories.  And  the  Mahatma  understood  that  better,  deeper,  and  earlier ",
  "than  all  the  Marxists,  market  messiahs,  materialists  and  behaviouralists.  He  intuited ",
  "that  it  is  also  about  dignity,  invulnerability,  self-control and freedom, and  mental and ",
  "psychological  unburdening.  From  that  perspective,  Nehrus  exhortation  that  \u201cso  long ",
  "as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over\u201d is very much true ",
  "nearly 70 years after independence.",
  "Today, an option to realise Gandhiji\u2019s objective presents itself and has entered the policy ",
  "consciousness in India and around the world: Universal Basic Income, UBI for short. UBI ",
  "has three components: Universality, Unconditionality, and Agency (by providing support ",
  "in the form of cash transfers to respect, not dictate, recipients\u2019 choices).",
  "The Conceptual/Philosophical Case for UBI",
  "Universal  Basic  Income  is  a  radical  and  compelling  paradigm  shift  in  thinking  about ",
  "both social justice and a productive economy. A universal basic income is, like many ",
  "rights,  unconditional  and  universal:  it  requires  that  every  person  should  have  a  right ",
  "to a basic income to cover their needs, just by virtue of being citizens. The time has ",
  "come to think of UBI for a number of reasons:38 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Social Justice: UBI is, first and foremost, a test of a just and non-exploitative society. ",
  "A Universal Basic Income promotes many of the basic values of a society which respects all ",
  "individuals as free and equal. It promotes liberty because it is anti-paternalistic, opens up ",
  "the possibility of flexibility in labour markets. It promotes equality by reducing poverty. It ",
  "promotes efficiency by reducing waste in government transfers. And it could, under some ",
  "circumstances,  even  promote  greater  productivity.  It  is  not  an  accident  that  Universal ",
  "Basic Income has been embraced both by thinkers of the Left and of the Right.",
  "Poverty  Reduction:  Conditional  on  the  presence  of  a  well-functioning  financial ",
  "system, a Universal Basic Income may simply be the fastest way of reducing poverty. ",
  "UBI is also, paradoxically, more feasible in a country like India, where it can be pegged at ",
  "relatively low levels of income but still yield immense welfare gains.",
  "Employment:  UBI  is  an  acknowledgement  that  society\u2019s  obligation  to  guarantee ",
  "a  minimum  living  standard  is  even  more  urgent  in  an  era  of  uncertain  employment ",
  "generation. Moreover, UBI could also open up new possibilities for labour markets. It ",
  "creates flexibility by allowing for individuals to have partial or calibrated engagements with ",
  "the labour market without fear of losing benefits. They allow for more non-exploitative ",
  "bargaining since individuals will no longer be forced to accept any working conditions, ",
  "just so that they can subsist.",
  "Administrative Efficiency: In India in particular, the case for UBI has been enhanced ",
  "because of the weakness of existing welfare schemes which are riddled with misallocation, ",
  "leakages and exclusion of the poor. When the trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile ",
  "(popularly referred to as JAM) is fully adopted the time would be ripe for a mode of ",
  "delivery that is administratively more efficient. The administrative argument however has ",
  "to be made with some care. While Aadhar is designed to solve the identification problem, it ",
  "cannot, on its own, solve the targeting problem. It is important to recognise that universal ",
  "basic income will not diminish the need to build state capacity: the state will still have to ",
  "enhance its capacities to provide a whole range of public goods. UBI is not a substitute for ",
  "state capacity: it is a way of ensuring that state welfare transfers are more efficient so that ",
  "the state can concentrate on other public goods.",
  "The Conceptual Case against UBI",
  "From an economic point of view there are three principal and related objections to a ",
  "universal  basic  income. The  first  is  whether UBI reduces the incentive to work. This ",
  "argument is vastly exaggerated. For one thing, the levels at which universal basic income ",
  "are likely to be pegged are going to be minimal guarantees at best; they are unlikely to ",
  "crowd incentives to work. One school of thought would argue that it truly is a diminution ",
  "of human dignity to suppose that the only motivation for which people work is necessity; ",
  "take away the yoke of necessity and they will be lazy. The same kinds of arguments used to ",
  "be made against high wages: that if wages rise beyond a certain level workers will choose ",
  "leisure over work. There is very little evidence to sustain that proposition.",
  "The second concern is this: Should income be detached from employment? The honest ",
  "economic answer to this concern is that society already does this, but largely for the POVERTY AND SOCIAL SECTOR 39",
  "rich and privileged. Any society where any form of inheritance or accepting non-work ",
  "related income is allowed, already detaches income from employment. So, receiving a ",
  "small unearned income as it were, from the state should be economically and morally less ",
  "problematic than the panoply of \u201cunearned\u201d income our societies allow.",
  "The third is a concern out of reciprocity. If society is indeed a \u201cscheme of social ",
  "cooperation\u201d,  should  income  be  unconditional,  with  no  regard  to  peoples  contribution ",
  "to society? The short answer is that individuals as a matter of fact will in most cases ",
  "contribute to society, as stated above. In fact, UBI can also be a way of acknowledging ",
  "non-wage work related contributions to society.",
  "In the current social structure, for example, homemaking contributions of women are ",
  "largely unacknowledged economically, since they do not take the form of wage or contract ",
  "employment. It is important that UBI is not framed as a transfer payment from the rich to ",
  "the poor. Its basis is rather different. UBI gives concrete expression to the idea that we have ",
  "a right to a minimum income, merely by virtue of being citizens. It is the acknowledgment ",
  "of the economy as a common project. This right requires that the basic economic structure ",
  "be configured in a way thate very individualg etsb asici ncome.",
