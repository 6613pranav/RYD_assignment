  "FOOD SECURITY",
  "The first aspect of food security is the domestic availability of food grains. No country ",
  "would ever be willing to depend on other countries for their requirement of food grains or ",
  "agricultural commodities, unless it does not have any other option. Since Independence, ",
  "India hast ravelled alo ng way towardsthe  foo d security,from  an im  porteroffoo d  grains,which  ",
  "ha snowach ieved  \u2018self-sufficiency\u2019in food gr ains,through the increased do mesticproduction.  ",
  "BufferStockofFoodGrains",
  "       ",
  "India is one among the few countries in the world having government-held stock of food ",
  "grains ,f orth efollowing  reaso ns:      ",
  "     ",
  "   (1)Bufferformeeting naturalcalamities;",
  "       ",
  "(2) Pricestabilization in caseofcrop failures;",
  "     ",
  "(3) Providing food grainsunderpublicdistribution system.",
  "     ",
  "The government has buffer stock norms for different months in a year. At present, the",
  "                         ",
  "maximum stock of the food grains of wheat and rice are to be held by the government, as",
  "                       ",
  "bufferstock isT7million tonnesto meettheaforesaid objectives.",
  "           ",
  "Food Corporation of India (FCI) has the prime responsibility of procuring the food ",
  "               ",
  "grains and the procurement is done at minimum support price (MSP) and stored in its",
  "                     ",
  "warehouses at different locations and from there it is supplied to the state governments",
  "                     ",
  "in terms of requirement. FCI also sells in the open market to stabilize, if their prices turn ",
  "                     ",
  "volatileespecially in periodsofcrop failures.",
  "     ",
  "Certain issueswhich arearound bufferstock operationsarebriefed asfollows:",
  "           ",
  "First, the government is currently  holding  many  multiples more than  that required ",
  "             ",
  "under the norms of around over 50-60 million tonnes, even when higher stocks have been ",
  "                 ",
  "held in the past. Why does the government hold higher stocks than required? It is because",
  "                     ",
  "of the MSP of food grains and also the procurement price; and at that price government",
  "                       ",
  "is mandatorily required to procure whatever arrives to FCI. If there is a bumper crop,",
  "                     ",
  "FCI will have to procure the entire stock. Even if the market price of the food grain is",
  "                           ",
  "higher, farmers prefer to sell to FCI because it procures in bulk. This leads in a buildup of",
  "                         ",
  "stocks.",
  "Second, FCI does not have enough storage capacity to hold the high levels of food ",
  "                 ",
  "grain stocks. At present, the entire capacity of FCI is around 60 million tonnes, while",
  "                   42 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "actual available storage, will not be more than 50 million tonnes. Even this storage is not ",
  "appropriate .There is a tremendous wastage of around \u20b9 50,000 crore annually by both on ",
  "account improper and on inadequate storagef acilities.",
  "The other aspect under food security is around the public distribution system (PDS). ",
  "Food grains are distributed to the state governments at an \u2018issue price\u2019 for their distribution ",
  "to  the  poor  through  the  PDS  at  prices,  much  below  their  economic  cost  (MSP  with ",
  "transportation and storage cost). As a result, the government has to bear the differential ",
  "cost between the economic cost and the price charged in the PDS, as \u2018food subsidy\u2019 of ",
  "over \u20b9 75,000 crore.",
  "PDS was a general entitlement for all the consumers or citizens, where a fixed amount ",
  "of food grains, sugar and edible oil were distributed through the dedicated government- ",
  "owned shops or outlets at a rate or price lower than the prevailing market rate. In a bid, to ",
  "ensure focus of PDS towards the poor or for the economically backward families and in ",
  "an attempt to stop pilferage and diversion of food grains to the open market, a \u2018Revamped ",
  "Public Distribution System (RPDS)\u2019 was launched in June 1992 in 1775 blocks (mostly ",
  "backward and remote areas) throughout the country.",
  "Subsequently, the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) was introduced effective ",
  "from June 1997, which envisaged subsidized distribution of food grains to poor families ",
  "(classified in India as below poverty line (BPL), above poverty line (APL) and poorest of ",
  "the poor families identified as Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY). TPDS was amended with ",
  "an intention to benefit around 6 crore (60 million) poor families for whom a quantity of ",
  "about 7.2 million tonnes of food grains was earmarked annually.",
  "The  identification of the  poor  under  the scheme is  performed by the states as per ",
  "poverty estimates of Planning Commission of India. In 2000, in view of the consensus ",
  "on increasing the allocation of food grains to BPL families, and also to better target the ",
  "program, the Indian government has increased the allocation to BPL families from 10 ",
  "to 20 kg of food grains per family per month at 50 per cent of the economic cost and ",
  "allocation to the APL families.",
  "The number of BPL families has been increased by shifting the base to the population ",
  "projections of the Registrar General as on 1 March 2000 instead of the earlier population ",
  "projections of 1995. This has increased the total number of BPL families who are at present ",
  "eligible for subsidized food grains. The allocation of food grains for the BPL families was ",
  "further increased from 20 to 25 kg per family per month with effective from July 2001. ",
  "Initially, the AAY families were provided 25 kg of food grains per family per month at the ",
  "time of launching of the scheme in December 2000. The scale of issue of food grains under ",
  "APL, BPL and AAY has been revised to 35 kg per family per month with effective as on ",
  "1 April 2002 with a view to enhance the food security at the household level.",
  "Under the  TPDS,  all  ration  card holders  have been segregated into APL and BPL ",
  "families. The BPL families acquire food grains, sugar and kerosene at one-half of the price ",
  "than that to the APL families.",
  "Further, the central government has another scheme known as AAY launched during ",
  "the year 2000, under which the bottom most 2.5 crore below poverty families get 35 kg of ",
  "                       ",

  "Issues in Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)\u2014Reasons",
  "The main flaw in the system that a large chunk of those who are eligible for subsidized ",
  "food  grains  under  BPL  category  have  been  left  out  leading  to  critically  question ",
  "comprehensiveness of TPDS.",
  "The criteria for inclusion in the BPL list are solely economical which is often understated ",
  "or under reported because lack of availability of national income data. There are allegations ",
  "that persons having political patronage have found a place in the BPL list. Not all BPL ",
  "families are actually\u2019 BPL, but are included. A large number of the very poor families ",
  "are in the APL category and are thus denied their right for acquiring the subsidized food ",
  "grains from TPDS.",
  "Further, the BPL families graduating in terms of income criteria should technically ",
  "be excluded as beneficiaries under BPL, however, they continue to do so. There is thus ",
  "incentive to be classified as a BPL family; as a result no family would like this tag to go. ",
  "In the existing system, there is \u2018no exit but entry\u2019 only, thus becoming an ever increasing ",
  "liability of the government, in terms of increase subsidy bill and the benefits \u2018not exactly\u2019 ",
  "those for whom it is intended.",

  "The other is the large-scale black marketing, hoardings and their diversion to open",

  "The special features of the National Food Security Act are:",
  "1.  Up to three-quarters of people in the rural areas and up to half of the urban population",
  "would get five kilograms of grains per month at subsidized prices (3 rupees per kilo ",
  "for rice, 2 rupees per kilo for wheat and 1 rupee per kilo for coarse grains).",
  "2. The poorest households would continue to receive 35 kilograms of grains per month ",
  "under the \u201cAntyodaya Anna Yojana\u201d at subsidized prices.",
  "3. Pregnant women and lactating mothers would receive a maternity benefit of at least ",
  "6,000 rupees.",
  "4. Children aged 6 months to 14 years would get take-home ration or hot cooked food. ",
  "The central government also would provide money to states and union territories, ",
  "if it has shortage / low stock of grain.",
  "5. The central government would also provide \u201cassistance\u201d towards the cost of intra\u00ad",
  "state transportation and handling of grains.",
  " 6. In a bid to give women more authority in running their households, the oldest adult ",
  "woman in each house would be considered the head of that household for issue of ",
  "ration card.",
  "What are the Issues around the Food Security Act?",
  "Food  security  should  be  envisioned  around  a  \u2018basic  nutrition  basket  of  goods\u2019  aimed ",
  "at  getting  rid  of  malnutrition  and  ensuring  nutrition  security\u2019  of  its  population.  Mere ",
  "inclusion of coarse cereals will not allow building nutrition security for its population. ",
  "Various  international  reports  have  clearly  mentioned  that  addressing,  both  hunger  and ",
  "malnutrition, should be accorded as the top most priority in India.",
  "Both in terms of\u2018hunger\u2019 and \u2018malnutrition\u2019, India ranks poorly. In terms of a study by ",
  "the International Food Policy Research Institute, India is ranked 67 out of 84 countries in ",
  "the Global Hunger Index.",
  "Implementing such a scheme at a massive level, without addressing the inefficiencies ",
  "in the delivery system, relative ability of the state governments, can well defeat the very ",
  "purpose of the scheme, of reaching out to the poor.",
  "Procurement of food grains of such magnitude would require not only augmenting but ",
  "also scaling-up storage capacity and improving the facilities in storing them. India may ",
  "well need to import food grains which would impact global food prices and also impacting ",
  "their prices in India.",
  "It  is  not  about  the  magnitude  of  the  subsidy  bill  and  their  provision  made  in  the ",
  "present  budget.  It  is  the  continuous  and  the  increasing  liability of any  government  in ",
  "perpetuity. How long can it be sustained in the future? Will such a scheme not provide ",
  "complacency to its population, of shying away from work with the \u2018assured food available\u2019 ",
  "without working to earn to buy the food?",
  "What Needs to be Done as a Part of Food Security?",
  "Initially, there is a need to have a mechanism to identify the beneficiaries or the poor ",
  "people. BPL cards are of conclusive proof of them being beneficiaries, but \u2018not a conclusive FOOD SECURITY 45",
  "proof of being below poverty line\u2019. This is the biggest challenge in addressing food security ",
  "in India.",
  "The government has set up the Unique Identification Authority of India, the first of its ",
  "Kind in the world with the ambitious objective of allotting biometric twelve digit unique ",
  "ID number to each and every person in the country under \u2018Aadhaar project\u2019. However, the ",
  "talks about the project will provide only a unique \u2018identity\u2019 to the people but not enable ",
  "ascertaining \u2018income or consumption expenditure\u2019 of the people, which is required for ",
  "identification of beneficiaries.",
  "The  best  way,  which  the  government  is  proposing,  is  by  following  the  \u2018exclusion ",
  "method\u2019,  of  excluding  certain  categories  as  beneficiaries,  rather  than  identifying  the ",
  "targeted beneficiaries. However, even this will require broad consensus on the categories ",
  "to be excluded and cannot be left to the state governments for uniformity purposes. One ",
  "category may be excluded by one state but the same category may be included by some ",
  "other state. Broad parameters of exclusion should be spelt out by the central government ",
  "through a process of consensus and leave the fine tuning to the respective state governments.",
  "As mentioned earlier, food security should be seen as \u2018nutrition security\u2019 providing food ",
  "grains to the people with \u2018mal nutrition\u2019 is a bigger damage. Objective of the government ",
  "should be not only to \u2018feed\u2019 but also have a \u2018fit\u2019 population.",
  "The  entire  TPDS  operations  of  procurement,  storage,  movement  and  its  ultimate ",
  "distribution  to  the  poor  should  be  computerized  with  a  technology  leveraged  tracking ",
  "mechanism throughout the country. Even though iti sa di fficult ta sk,it can  becre ated by the",

  "Storage capacity has to be increased at least by about 15\u201420 million tonnes in the ",
  "immediate short run. There is a need to adopt the public private sector partnership (PPP) ",
  "for  streamlining  storage,  storage  facilities  transportation  and  establishing  an  efficient ",
  "delivery chain.",
  "Any subsidy mechanism is always inefficient as there is bound to be leakages, no matter ",
  "what efforts are made, to plug them. The only better way to reach out to the poor people ",
  "is providing direct income support, to the extent subsidy is to be given. For example, if the ",
