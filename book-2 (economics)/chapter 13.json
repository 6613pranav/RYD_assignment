  "13.1 FISCAL POLICY IN INDIA",
  "The government does not perform any business so it cannot earn money to spend. Hence, ",
  "the  government  has to  raise  the money from  the  economy to  enable it to spend that ",
  "money in terms of requirements and national priorities. The government raises money ",
  "primarily through \u2018taxes\u2019 and the spending known as \u2018public expenditure\u2019. A policy which ",
  "iffects either the manner in which the government raises resource or spends is known as ",
  "fiscal policy\u2019. The objectives of any fiscal policy of a country' are as follows:",
  "1)To ensur e tha t th e expenditur e in an economy is in terms  of  national  priorities,  to ",

  "               ",
  "creation ofassetsin an economy and isthusdesirableforgrowth.144 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "For example, money spent for setting up power plant is a capital expenditure. Revenue ",
  "expenditure is recurring in nature, for maintenance, etc.",
  "The other is the non-plan expenditure which is an expenditure not covered in the five- ",
  "year plan but yet has to be incurred and could again be either revenue or capital. In India, ",
  "non-plan expenditure is 70 per cent of the total expenditure whereas plan expenditure is ",
  "only 30 per cent. The highest expenditure is non-plan revenue expenditure accounting for ",
  "63 per cent of total expenditure.",
  "What are the components of non-plan revenue expenditure? The first is the interest ",
  "payments  (servicing  of  the  loans  taken  by  the  central  government  both  internal  and ",
  "external) accounting for over 25 per cent of the total expenditure. Secondly, subsidies ",
  "(food, fertilizers and retail petroleum goods). Thirdly establishment expenses of defense. ",
  "Fourthly, loans to state govemments/UT, establishment expenses of central government, ",
  "pension  to  defence/central  government  retired  personnel.  Expenditure  on  these  heads ",
  "would account for over 90 per cent of non-plan revenue expenditure. These expenses are ",
  "also known as consumption of the government as no assets are created.",
  "RECEIPTS BY THE GOVERNMENT",
  "The expenditure in an economy is met out of receipts by the government through various ",
  "sources. The receipts could be revenue (which do not create any interest liability for the ",
  "government, regularity in their receipts and not representing borrowings) and the other ",
  "as capital (cither creating a liability for the government or less certain of their receipt or ",
  "borrowings). Of the total receipts, 90 per cent is revenue and 10 per cent is capital receipts. ",
  "The primary source of revenue receipts is tax revenue (84 per cent of total receipts). Taxes ",
  "could be either direct or indirect.",
  "How to distinguish direct tax from indirect tax? Direct tax is a tax where the subject on ",
  "whom the tax has been levied is identifiable, who has to pay the tax and the tax burden cannot ",
  "be shifted. Examples can be income tax, corporate taxes, wealth tax, etc. In case if the subject ",
  "is not identifiable or if the burden can be shifted it is an indirect tax. Common examples ",
  "are excise duty (payable by companies on manufacturing activities), customs duty (duty on ",
  "import of goods), service tax (tax on services being rendered by service providers), etc.",
  "Fifty-five per cent of the tax revenue arrives through direct taxes while 45 per cent of ",
  "the revenue is from indirect taxes. The base on which the tax is applied for indirect taxes ",
  "could either be on value (ad valorem) or specific on a particular attribute (length of staples ",
  "in cotton). India primarily follows an ad valorem indirect tax structure.",
  "Certain taxes are levied by the central government and at the same time it is also ",
  "collected by the central government (income tax, customs duty, excise duty and service ",
  "tax), certain taxes levied by the central government bur collected by the state governments ",
  "(central sales tax levied on inter-state movement of goods). A few other taxes are levied and ",
  "collected by the respective state governments (sales rax, octroi, municipal taxes, road tax, ",
  "entertainment tax and agriculture tax).",
  "The basis of sharing the rax revenue between the centres and the states are decided by ",
  "the  finance  commission.  The  thirteenth  finance  commission  under  the  chairmanship  of ",
  "Shri Vijay Kelkar has since submitted its report and is effective from 2010 to 2015.GOVERNMENT FINANCES 145",
  "There are two additional taxes\u2014one is the surcharge which is imposed for additional ",
  "revenue considerations by imposing an additional percentage on the absolute amount of ",
  "tax payable. Suppose surcharge on at ax is5  perce ntan d thetax  payableis\u20b9 10 0  then thetotal ",

  "tax liability including surchargewould be \u20b9105.",
  "                         ",
  "The other is cess which is similar in application as the surcharge except that the amount",
  "                   ",
  "collected by way of cess is meant solely for specific funding/cause like education cess, the",
  "     ",
  "amountcollected would go forfunding ofeducation only.",
  "                 ",
  "Components of revenue receipts other than  taxes are dividends received  by  the",
  "                       ",
  "government from public sector, payment of interest by the state governments etc. Similarly,",

  "NATUREOFGOVERNMENTBUDGET",
  "                     ",
  "Thus, so far we have discussed the expenditure and receipts. What happens if expenditure",
  "                     ",
  "exceeds receipts? It would result in a deficit or otherwise in a surplus and if both match ",
  "then balanced.",

  "What is good for an economy\u2014a deficit, surplus or a balanced budget? To answer this",
  "                     ",
  "question, a few aspects should be understood. There is a difference between personal and ",
  "               ",
  "government budget and that being in a personal budget, spending is strictly in accordance",
  "                 ",
  "with  income. However, in  a government budget, it is important to  understand  that",
  "                     ",
  "expenditure is seen first and the reason for receipt is because of the need for spending in ",

  "government scales-down spending to match the receipts. This could drag down growth ",
  "               ",
  "as lesser expenditure is taking place. More so in India, given the inflexibility to bring ",

  "Still the government in line with the above had set definite time frame for reducing ",
  "the fiscal and revenue deficit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management ",
  "Act (FRBMA) for gradual reduction of revenue deficit by 0.5 per cent every year to be ",
  "brought down to zero by 2007-2008. In respect of fiscal deficit the aim was to reduce it ",
  "by 0.3 per cent every year beginning from 2004 to 2005. Clearly, the targets have not been ",
  "achieved.",
  "The global crisis initiated during 2007 required a fiscal stimulus package to ensure that ",
  "the Indian economy does not slip into a recession and a conscious decision taken to relax ",
  "the FRBMA provisions until the situation is improved.",
  "If the expenditure needs are inflexible and deficits have to be checked the only way is ",
  "to augment the receipts and this is where the government has focused through tax reforms ",
  "with the taxes being a major source of receipts for the government as it offered great ",
  "potential. There is a need to increase the tax to GDP ratio which is presently around 10 ",
  "per cent especially given the growth of the economy there should be proportionately larger ",
  "increase in tax revenue.",
  "13.7 TAX REFORMS\u2014INDIRECT TAXES",
  "It  was  mentioned  previously  that  indirect  taxes  contribute  about  45  per  cent  of  the ",
  "tax revenue. A major source of indirect taxes is excise duty which is payable on value ",
  "of manufacturing activities in the economy. Excise duty like other indirect taxes by its ",
  "inherent structure is regressive in nature.",
  "For example,t hee xcisedu ty on saltis1 0 p ercento n afa ctory  priceof \u20b910 w  hi ch  meansthe",

  "Secondly, multiple excise structure with  multiple rates giving  rise to  different",
  "               ",
  "interpretation on tax payable giving scope for evasion, litigations and revenue loss to the",
  "               ",
  "government.",
  "The third issue in excise is the cascading effect of taxes. For example, Maruti buys tyres",
  "                         ",
  "from MRF company. The purchase price of tyres from MRF would have a component",
  "                         ",
  "of excise duty, which becomes the input price for Maruti and excise duty has to be paid ",
  "                       ",
  "on the frill value of car. This is known as the cascading effect, that is, taxes increase the",
  "                             ",
  "manufacturing costand getagain taxed.",
  "   ",
  "The government has tried to address the issue by reducing the slabs of excise duty only ",

  "and lowerexciseduty on essentialsormassgoodsto minimizetheregressivecharacter.With ",
  "                   ",
  "regard to the cascading effect, the best way to prevent it is by introducing value added tax ",
  "               ",
  "VAT) which is a tax on the value additions at each stage of production rather than on the",
  "                     ",
  "finished goods. Provided the federal structure both centre and state government VAT would ",
  "               ",
  "haveto beatboth levels.",
  "     148 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "An initiation was made with the government by first introducing the modified value ",
  "added tax (MODVAT) scheme which allowed partial adjustment of duties on capital goods ",
  "purchased, however, it was restrictive in nature. The government replaced MODVAT with ",
  "a wider scheme of input credit for the excise duties inputs (raw materials, capital goods ",
  "and services) purchased for direct use in production known as central value added tax ",
  "(CENVAT) at the central level during 2004.",
  "    A majorreform hasbee n at thestat elev elwi th the replacem  entofsalest ax  with  state",
  "VAT. The credit for this goes to Shri. Asim Das Gupta the then Finance Minister, West ",
  "Bengal and can be hailed as a landmark in tax reforms.",
  "\u2018Why\u2019 it is a major reform? First to make all the state governments to agree for the ",
  "replacement of sales tax with a state VAT. The sales tax regime was very complicated with ",
  "different sales tax rates for same products in different states. A state VAT required one ",
  "product one tax rate\u2019 across all states and to drive a consensus for this was herculean effort ",
  "as some states would stand to gain and others would tend to lose.",
  "If in a particular state sales tax was a high of say 24 per cent but the consensus under ",
  "a state VAT was only 12.5 per cent for that good clearly there would be revenue loss for ",
  "that state government.",
  "State VAT made effective from 1 April 2005 has the following salient features:",
  "(1)  State VAT is not a new tax but only a change in the way of collecting tax from the ",
  "final stage to the value addition stage.",
  "(2)  This allows for set-off of duties from the tax payable but against original invoices/ ",
  "           ",

  "                     ",
  "(3) There would be a uniform 4 per cent state VAT on 270 mass-consumed goods across",
  "                     ",

  "tax (GST) with both the c entre a nd states ta xing concurrency as the  cen tral go vernment  ",

  "TAX REFORMS\u2014DIRECT TAXES",
  "13.8",
  "Direct taxes as seen earlier contribute 55 per cent of the tax revenue and it is a better ",
  "way of taxation as it is progressive in nature and based on \u2018ability to pay\u2019, higher the ",
  "income, progressively, more the tax rate leading to greater revenue with least burden on ",
  "the masses or those with low income. Direct taxes particularly income tax is progressive ",
  "and in contrast to other taxes which are regressive in nature.",
  "The progressivity of income taxes in periods of inflation pushes people up the tax ",
  "bracket, as pay packets get inflated due to inflation resulting in higher taxes paid and ",
  "reduced spending by the individuals. On one hand, the coffers of the government fills up ",
  "because of people moving up the tax bracket and on the other there is a reduced spending. ",
  "This phenomenon is known as \u2018Fiscal drag\u2019.",
  "How many people do you think are tax payers in the economy?",
  "At present, 4.0 per cent are tax payers in the Indian economy, about 37 million in a ",
  "population of over one billion people. This number is low especially considering the fact that ",
  "India in its growing economy, with increased income, rising middle class, the affluent class ",
  "and large number joining the elite billionaire club. In comparison, the number of tax payers ",
  "has only increased by 11 per cent.",
  "What are the ways through which tax payers and tax revenue can be increased? There ",
  "could be three ways through which it can be increased and are as follows:",
  "Increase in the direct tax rates. ",
  "1)",
  "2) Increase in the tax base. ",
  "3) Enforce tax compliance.",
  "Increase in Tax Rate",
  "Any increase in tax rate is seen negatively and resented by the people. There is also a ",
  "relationship between the direct tax rate and revenue generated. Starting from a low tax ",
  "rate and gradually increasing it, is positively related and increases tax revenue. However, ",
  "beyond  a  level,  any  increase  in  tax rates  becomes  counter-productive  as  it  lowers tax ",
  "revenue rather than in increasing it. This is popularly known as the \u2018Laffer curve\u2019.",
  "An economy being on the Laffer curve implies that any increase in tax rates would ",
  "lower the tax revenue and on the contrary lowering of tax rate would lead to increased ",
  "revenue for the government. It is widely believed that India is on the Laffer curve with ",
  "limited prospects of raising taxes.",
  "This  is  because  high  tax  rates  lead  to  tax  evasion,  non-disclosure  of  income  and ",
  "generation of black money (taxes not paid). All efforts are made to minimize the incidence ",
  "of taxes legally and illegally. It serves as a disincentive in the economy leading to lowering ",
  "of income and the output. Hence, raising tax rates is not an option available in India.",
  "Increase in Tax Base",
  "Tax base refers to that threshold level of income on which taxes become applicable. India ",
  "has an exemption level,th atis, ifi nco meisle sst han \u20b9  2.5 lakh perannum taxesar enot      150 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "payable. So one way could be to lower the exemption level so that more people are drawn ",
  "in the tax net and thereby an increase in tax payers and tax revenue.",
  "At present, the exemption level is very low given the present inflation. Besides the ",
  "inflation does not factor in cost of education, transport and property prices all of which ",
  "have increased manifold in recent times creating hardships and making it difficult for the ",
  "middle class to make both the ends meet. Lowering the exemption would further burden ",
  "the middle class and more so by this way it may be possible to increase the \u2018number of tax ",
  "payers\u2019 but \u2018not necessarily tax revenue\u2019 as many would be marginal tax payers.",
  "The other way to increase the tax base is to bring in untaxed sectors under the tax net. ",
  "All sectors with the possible exception of the agricultural sector are already under the tax ",
  "net. Agriculture being a state subject can be taxed only by the state government and not ",
  "by the central government. Thus, like increasing tax rate, even increasing tax base is not a ",
  "feasible option for raising direct tax revenue in India.",
  "Ensuring Tax Compliance",
  "This is to ask the question that, is every person who ought to pay taxes is paying his/her ",
  "taxes in terms of existing laws and the second are the people who are not paying should ",
  "actually be paying taxes. This is what is meant by tax compliance. The government has ",
  "made an initiation by making the income tax return form user friendly and easy to fill up ",
  "by an individual and it is known as \u2018Saral\u2019.",
  "Th e proble m in Indi a  is tha t o f tax complianc e with lot of leakages, large-scale tax ",
  "evasion and black money. It is estimated that over 40 per cent of GDP is black money ",
  "which is circulating in the economy on which no taxes are paid.",
  "GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: PROGRESSIVE TAX REGIME",
  "India\u2019s biggest tax reform since independence ,Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into ",

  "By subsuming most of the Central and State taxes into a single tax and by allowing ",
  "a set-off of prior-stage taxes for the transactions across the entire value chain, it would ",
  "mitigate the ill effects of cascading, improve competitiveness and improve liquidity of the ",
  "businesses.",
  "GST is a destination based tax. It follows a multi-stage collection mechanism. In this, ",
  "tax is collected at every stage and the credit of tax paid at the previous stage is available as a ",
  "set off at the next stage of transaction. This shifts the tax incidence near to the consumer and ",

  "1. GST is largely technology driven. It will reduce the human interface to a great ",
  "extent and this would lead to speedy decisions.GOVERNMENT FINANCES 151",
  "2. GST will give a major boost to the \u2018Make in India initiative of the Government ",
  "of  India  by  making  goods  and  services  produced  in  India  competitive  in  the ",
  "National as well as International market. Also all imported goods will be charged ",
  "integrated tax (IGST) which is equivalent to Central GST + State GST. This will ",
  "bring equality with taxation on local products.",
  "3. Under the GST regime, exports will be zero-rated in entirety unlike the present ",
  "system where refund of some taxes may not take place due to fragmented nature ",
  "of indirect taxes between the Centre and the States. This will boost Indian exports ",
  "in  the  international  market  thus  improving  the  balance  of  payments  position. ",
  "Exporters with clean track record will be rewarded by getting immediate refund ",
  "of 90% of their claims arising on account of exports, within seven days.",
  "4. GST is expected to bring buoyancy to the Government Revenue by widening the ",
  "tax base and improving the taxpayer compliance. GST is likely improve India\u2019s ",
  "ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index and is estimated to increase the ",
  "GDP growth by 1.5 to 2%.",
  "GST will bring more transparency to indirect tax laws. Since the whole supply ",

  "present concept of tax on the manufacture or sale of goods or provision of services. ",
  "It  would  be  a  destination  based  consumption  tax.  This  means  that  tax  would ",
  "accrue to the State or the Union Territory where the consumption takes place. It ",
  "would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying tax on ",
  "a common tax base. The GST to be levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of ",
  "goods or services would be called the Central tax (CGST) and that to be levied by ",
  "the States including Union territories with legislature/Union Territories without152 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "legislature would be called the State tax (SGST)/ Union territory tax (UTGST ",
  "respectively.",
  "(ii) The  GST  would  apply  to  all  goods  other  than  alcoholic  liquor  for  human ",
  "consumption  and  five  petroleum  products,  viz.  petroleum  crude,  motor  spirit ",
  "(petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel. It would apply to ",
  "all services barring a few to be specified. The GST would replace the  following taxes ",

  "(v) An Integrated tax (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter\u00ad",
  "State supply of goods and services. Accounts would be settled periodically between ",
  "the  Centre  and  the  States  to  ensure  that  the  SGST/UTGST  portion  of  IGST ",
  "is transferred to the destination State where the goods or services are eventually ",
  "consumed.",
  "(vi) Use of Input Tax Credit: Taxpayers shall be allowed to take credit of taxes paid on ",
  "inputs (input tax credit) and utilize the same for payment of output tax. However, ",
  "no  input  tax  credit  on  account  of  CGST  shall  be  utilized  towards  payment  of ",

  "shall have an option to either pay output tax and claim its refund or export under ",
  "bond without tax and claim refund of Input lax Credit.",
  "(viii) Import of Goods and Services would be treated as inter-State supplies and would ",

  "in his return. Taxpayer can take credit of taxes paid on all goods and services, other than ",
  "a few items in the negative list, and utilize the same for payment of output tax. Credit ",

  "In the wake of the demonetisation, the government has taken a number of steps to ",
  "facilitate and incentivize the move to a digital economy. These include:",
  "Launch of the BHIM (Bharat Interface For Money) app for smartphones. This is based ",
  "on the new Unified Payments Interface (UPI) which has created inter-operability of digital ",
  "transactions. The 250 million digital-haves can use their smartphone to make simple and ",

  "Launch of BHIM USSD 2.0, a product that allows the 350 million feature phone users ",

  "Launch of Aadhaar Merchant Pay, aimed at the 350 million who do not have phones. ",

  "Encouraging  the  adoption  of  POS  devices  beyond  the  current  1.5  million,  through ",

  "Benefits of Demonetisation",
  "Tax  on  black  money:  The  most  important  way  to  view  demonetisation  is  as  a  tax ",
  "administration  measure,  one  designed  to  tax  holdings  of  black  money.  Of  course, ",
  "demonetisation  of  large  denomination  notes is not  exactly  the same as demonetisation ",
  "of black money. Some cash holdings were perfectly \u201cwhite\u201d, the fruit of income upon ",
  "which taxes had either been paid or had not been applicable in the first place (agricultural ",
  "income, for example).",
  "Cash holdings arising from income that had been declared could readily be deposited ",
  "at banks and ultimately exchanged for new notes. But those with black money faced three ",
  "difficult choices. They could:",
  "\u2022  Declare their unaccounted wealth and pay taxes at a penalty rate;",
  "\u2022  Continue to hide it, not converting their old notes and thereby suffering a tax rate of ",
  "100 percent; or",
  "\u2022  Launder their black money, paying a cost for converting the money into white.",
  "Tax compliance: Demonetisation can also be interpreted as a regime shift on the part of ",
  "the government. It is a demonstration of the state\u2019s resolve to crack down on black money, ",
  "showing that tax evasion will no longer be tolerated or accepted as an inevitable part of ",
  "life.  Since  this  action  has  commanded support  amongst the  population,  demonetisation ",
  "shows that black money will no longer be tolerated by the wider public, either.",
  "Demonetisation  could  also  aid  tax  administration  in  another  way,  by  shifting ",
  "transactions out of the cash economy and into the formal payments system. With large ",
  "denominations  eliminated,  households  and  firms  have  begun  to  shift  from  cash  to ",
  "electronic payment technologies.",
  "Tax  on  informal  savings:  Beyond  reducing  tax  evasion,  demonetisation  could  have ",
  "other farreaching effects. For example, it will channel savings into the formal financial ",
  "system. Without doubt, much of the cash that has been deposited in the banking system GOVERNMENT FINANCES 157",
  "will be  taken  out again,  as the cash withdrawal limits are eased and the note supply ",
  "improves. But some of the new deposits will surely remain in the banks, where they will ",
  "provide a base for banks to provide more loans, at lower interest rates.",
  "In the longer-term, if demonetisation is successful, it will reduce the equilibrium cash- ",
  "GDP and cash-deposits ratio in the economy. This will increase financial savings which ",
  "could have a positive impact on long run growth.",
  "VIEWS ON TAX COMPLIANCE",
  "13.11",
  "(1)  Has it ever occurred why people do not want to pay taxes? Paying taxes globally is ",
  "a matter of pride and joining hands with the government to provide better for the ",
  "masses and improved civic amenities. Not so in India.",
  "(2)  That  is,  because,  people  doubt  the  intentions  of  the  government  in  using  it ",
  "productively for the masses. Tax compliance would thus require austerity measures ",
  "on the government lesser lavish spending and more responsiveness and sensitiveness ",
  "towards the spending for masses.",
  "(3)  Tax compliance should be top-driven. Have you ever seen any top political leader, ",
  "bureaucrat going to file his income tax return at the IT office in-person. No! it is ",
  "not required officially but it sends the right message to people that how it is of high ",
  "priority despite their busy schedule. Who is the first person seen as voting in an ",
  "election? It is the President, Prime Minister and other top leaders. \u2018Why?\u2019 Just to send ",
  "the right message to the people to come out and cast their vote.",
  "(4)  Hence  tax  compliance  should  start right  from  the top.  The  President,  PM,  Chief ",
  "Ministers and senior leaders all of them filing their tax returns in-person.",
  "(5)  Who is the highest tax payer in the country? It is difficult to say or even more difficult ",
  "to say who are the top 100 tax payers in the country. What prevents the government ",
  "from honouring them at a public ceremony acknowledging their contribution to the ",
  "national cause? It will transmit positive signals and encourage people to pay their ",
  "taxes.",
  "(6)  What if one is seen by one\u2019s friend or relative at the income tax office? It would ",
  "definitely not be positive. The perception of the income tax officials has got to change ",
  "from treating everyone as a tax evader to that of trust, a friend guiding and supporting ",
  "the people. Let them have \u2018May I help you counter\u2019 at their offices for any assistance ",
  "people may want. They could send out staff to assist tax payers in correctly filing their ",
  "returns. It should not be difficult but could go a long way in increasing the compliance.",
  "(7)  It is not difficult to find out regular tax payers, a small well-worded thank you card can ",
  "be sent to them each time after they have filed their return. Today, technology support ",
  "is available to generate such computerized letters. What is being meant here is that the ",
  "incentive for a tax payer to pay his taxes, a mere token of appreciation can work.",
  "(8)  Our policies for tax evasion can be said to be \u2018soft\u2019. What is required is strong ",
  "punishment for tax evaders, those generating black money uniform for all irrespective ",
  "of whether political leader, bureaucrat, private organization, etc., to serve as a lesson ",
  "and a source of discouragement.",
  "While tax compliance would remain an issue, still there are some other issues which ",
  "can help augment revenue to the government like completely simplified tax regime based ",
  "on income at low rates with no exemptions easily enforceable and minimizing leakages.158 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",

  "  changing the tax rates).",
  " E effectiveness (promoting tax compliance).",
  "C cost-effective (lower cost of collection with increased tax revenue).",
  "N neutral to economic decisions (not influencing location of businesses).",
  "The present tax structure in India is still evolving and moving in the right direction ",
  "of a GST for indirect taxes and direct tax code for direct taxes. While all these efforts ",
  "at increasing tax compliance are appreciable there are other issues which should also get ",
  "adequate attention of the government and that is cost of collection of taxes is continuously ",
  "increasing. There is a requirement to arrest this trend and ensure higher collections at lower ",
  "costs.",
  "The  other  is  given  the  inflexibility  of  expenditure,  there  is  scope  for  rationalizing ",
  "government expenditure by reviewing the requirement for so many ministries, merging ",
  "ministries  for  sharper  focus,  abolition  of  vacant  posts,  greater  austerity  in  government ",
  "spending and small expenditure cuts wherever feasible. It is these small cuts which would ",
  "make the picture larger. And for once economics should prevail over political compulsions ",
  "in the larger interests of the economy.",
  "Typical Budget in India",
  "We have covered public expenditure, taxes and different kinds of deficits as part of the ",
  "budgetary process. A typical budget presentation initiates with a review of the economy in ",
  "terms of the Economic Survey presented in the Parliament (a few days before the budget ",
  "is presented), which is followed by the expenditure proposals and finally the tax proposals ",
  "which most anxiously awaited by all.",
  "All receipts in the economy are retained in the consolidated fund of India and money ",
  "can be utilized only after the budget is passed by both the Houses of Parliament, which is ",
  "that Parliament provides approval for various expenditure and permits withdrawal of funds ",
  "for various expenditure needs of the economy. Certain expenses can be incurred by the ",
  "government without the approval of Parliament and are known as \u2018charged expenditure\u2019 ",
  "such as meeting interest obligations, salaries and emoluments to constitutionally appointed ",
  "heads such as chief justice of India, CVC, CAG, etc.",
  "There are two other kinds of budgets interim and vote on account. Interim is a kind of ",
  "budget addressed for a period less than a Rill year. Vote on account is not a type of budget ",
  "strictly, but seeks approval for ongoing expenditure needs, no fresh expenditure or tax ",
  "proposals. This is normally presented when the government is about to face elections or ",
  "when the time period is too short even for an interim budget to be presented. In any case, ",
  "the choice of the type of budget to be presently lies with the government.",
  "In case, election dare has already been announced the election commission is empowered ",
  "to  restrain  the  government  from  presenting  an  interim  budget  but  present  a  vote  on ",
  "account only. Traditionally, budgets are shrouded with secrecy and it lacks transparency.GOVERNMENT FINANCES 159",
  "There should be greater and broader participation of people from all walks of life to ensure ",
  "budgets being prepared are not only of the government but also of the people.",
  "The budgets are focused on \u2018outlays\u2019 or spending under different heads but no provision ",
  "is made to know the outcome\u2019 of such spending. The ocher aspect is the outlays are not ",
  "linked  to  the  actual  need.  For  example,  the  budget  might propose increased outlay of ",

  "May. If the Budget is read in January and passed by February-March, it would enable ",

  "\u2022  Retired and serving officials say the biggest plus would be that the Finance Bill, ",

  "To dispense with Plan-non-Plan dichotomy in expenditure from 2017-18",
  "From 2017-18, the Central Government expenditure will be classified only as capital and ",
  "revenue spends.",
  "The move is a part of the governments decision to do away with the classification of ",
  "Plan and Non-Plan expenditure. In line with the government\u2019s decision to dismantle the160 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Planning Commission, the new spending classification will come at a time when the Five- ",
  "Year Plan mechanism will also end. Instead, it will be replaced by a medium to long-term ",
  "planning system under the NITI Aayog.",
  "The classifications in the Union Budget 2016-17 for Centrally-sponsored schemes have ",
  "already been changed to \u201ccore of the core\u201d, \u201ccore\u201d and \u201coptimal\u201d.",

  "focusing on thee nd useo fth efu nds.",
  "Plan expenditure, denotes the more productive use of government resources as investment ",
  "in various programmes and schemes, but forms a small chunk of the total spending bill. ",
  "Non-Plan expenditure, on the other hand, is the majority of the government spending and ",
  "is used for interest payments, subsidies, wages and grants to States.",
  "Plan/Non-Plan will help in resolving the following issues",
  "\u2022  This distinction of expenditure had led to a fragmented view of resource allocation ",
  "to various schemes.",
  "\u2022  It had made it difficult to ascertain cost of delivering a service and also to link ",
  "outlays to outcomes.",
  "\u2022  It had led to bias in favour of Plan expenditure by Centre as well as the State ",
  "Governments  and  had  neglected  essential  expenditures  on  maintenance  of  assets ",
  "and other establishment related expenditures to provide essential social services.",
  "\u2022  The merger is expected to provide appropriate budgetary framework that will have ",

  "The separate Railway Budget, a 92-year-old tradition, has been scrapped by the centre. ",

  "for the Railways, since its revenue deficit and capital expenditure will now get transferred ",
  "to the Finance Ministry.",
  "The Railways is also facing an accumulated burden of a whopping Rs. 4.83 lakh crore ",

  "The budgets year after year get engaged in micro issues for example taxes on tooth ",

  "SOME OTHER FORMS OF BUDGETING",

  "Zero-Based Budgeting - ZBB",
  "This is a method of budgeting in which all expenses must be justified for each financial ",
  "year. The process of this budgeting starts from a \u201czero base,\u201d on every financial year. Every ",
  "function within the ministry or department is analyzed for its needs and costs. Budget ",
  "allocations are then made according to the need of ensuing financial year.",
  "Outcome Budget",
  "The Outcome Budget is a progress card on what various Ministries and Departments have ",
  "done with the budget allocation in the previous budget. Outcome based budgeting is a ",
  "practice of suggesting and listing of estimated outcomes of each programmes or schemes ",
  "designed.",
  "Gender Budget",
  "A  Gender  Budget  or  Gender-Responsive  Budget  is  a  budget  allocation  that  considers ",
  "the gender patterns in the society and allocates the resources to implement policies and ",
  "programs to help moving society towards a more gender equal society.",
  "Gender  Budget  disaggregates  the  mainstream  budget  according  to  its  impacts  on ",
  "women and men. It visualizes the process of conceiving, planning, approving, executing, ",
  "monitoring, analyzing and auditing budgets in a gender-sensitive way.",
  "Performance Budgeting",
  "Performance Budgeting also known as Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS) ",
  "is an attempt to integrate budgeting with overall planning of the country as a whole. It 162 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "tries to make the planning, execution, and evaluation of government policies in a more ",
  "systematic manner. The centre for PPBS is the budget; the methods used are planning and ",
