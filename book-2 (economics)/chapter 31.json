  "REGIONAL TRADING",
  "So far, we have discussed various components of the external sector, generic process of ",
  "globalization  and  the  strategies  being  followed  for  opening  of  economies.  A  reference ",
  "was  also  made  to  the  basis  of  trade  across  countries,  which  was  more  economic  in ",
  "nature based on the theory of comparative advantage of goods being traded depending ",
  "on  their  relative  cost  of  production  in  different  economies,  based  on  their  resource ",
  "endowments.",
  "However,  a  new  dimension  to  trading  has  been  given  through  regional  trading ",
  "or  trading  across  regions  having  some  degree  of  commonality  as  a  region,  proximity, ",
  "or  culture,  tastes  and  preferences,  similar  resources,  etc.,  or  any  such  common ",
  "denominator.",
  "This is in complete contrast to trading with the Rest of the World (ROW) which is based ",
  "on economic criteria and results in measurable welfare gains for all.",
  "Need for Regional Trading",
  "(1)  Even though it is widely accepted that trading with the ROW is far more beneficial ",
  "for economies, over 60 per cent of the global trade is through 200 odd regional blocs ",
  "in the world. Economies are being driven towards regional trading out of domestic ",
  "compulsions  of  looking  at  newer  markets  for  their  products  outside  domestic ",
  "boundaries.",
  "(2)  Regional trading allows for judging of competitiveness and acceptability of domestic ",
  "goods.",
  "(3)  It enables all the trading partners to collectively have a \u2018larger\u2019 voice in the international ",
  "arena on international issues.",
  "(4)  Regional trading is always meant to achieve penetration of markets, increased trade ",
  "and host of other objectives such as economic cooperation, jointly addressing issues ",
  "of energy, environment, political consensus on global issues, etc.306 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(5)  It provides for greater bonding across regions facilitating investment in economics.",
  "(6)  It opens economies for tourism, exchange programmes achieving greater degree of ",
  "cohesion among member countries.",
  "Nature of Regional Trading",
  "First, it can be bilateral (two countries), trilateral (three countries) or pluri-lateral (more ",
  "than three countries) but can never be multilateral. That is, to say the \u2018region\u2019 and not the ",
  "\u2018product\u2019 has to be the basis of trade. This is the basic difference between regional and ",
  "multilateral trading, of the former around regions and the latter across products and not ",
  "across a given geography but traded globally. Secondly, it could be trade agreements which ",
  "give preferential treatment to goods of member countries. Thirdly, it could be broader in ",
  "nature by looking at areas of economic cooperation, joint ventures, etc. Fourthly, it could ",
  "be deeper framework agreements looking for cementing ties between member countries ",
  "and government level cooperation.",
  "Most of the regional trading is around trade agreements. Economic cooperation and ",
  "framework agreements are of recent origin and in an evolutionary phase.",
  "Trade Agreements",
  "Each and every economy has its own set of restrictions of goods coming into the country ",
  "by imposition of import duty also known as tariffs. An important constituent of any trade ",
  "agreement would be either gradual reduction of the tariff levels on different product lines ",
  "or even their elimination. Even before entering into any trading agreement, as a first step, ",
  "is according status of most favoured nation (MFN), which is based on the principle of non ",
  "discrimination of goods in terms of tariffs and import duties on goods coming from that ",
  "country in relation to goods coming from ROW.",
  "Trading agreements is the next step, around goods and tariffs/import duties and can ",
  "be of various levels:",
  "Level 1\u2014under this, the member countries agree to give a preference in the import duty or ",
  "tariffs for defined product line. This is referred as preferential tariff agreements ",
  "(PTA). Let us say, tariff line on pens is 10 per cent for a country, a PTA would ",
  "mean that pen coming from a member country would attract a lower tariff of ",
  "say 8 per cent, and if coming from ROW then tariff lines would be 10 per cent. ",
  "Level 2\u2014the member countries agree to drop tariff levels to zero on defined product lines ",
  "or agree to drop it to zero over a given time frame. While member countries drop ",
  "tariffs to zero, each of them is free to have a different tariff for trading with the ",
  "ROW. This is referred as free trade agreements (FTA).REGIONAL TRADING BLOCS 307",
  "Level 3\u2014it is similar to Level 2 except that the member countries, besides having free ",
  "trade amongst them, also agree to a have a common tariff line\u2019 for dealing with ",
  "the ROW. This is referred as \u2018Customs Union\u2019.",
  "Level 4\u2014the deepest form of regional trading is besides free trade amongst them but also ",
  "agree to have a common currency and a common monetary policy.",
  "Issues in Regional Trading",
  "The first is defining the \u2018sensitive list\u2019, or a negative list which would not be open to trade, ",
  "those product lines on whom tariffs would not be reduced. This is also referred as trading ",
  "to a negative list, which means trading in goods, other than those in the negative list. Very ",
  "often it is not possible to arrive at a consensus by the member countries. The second is the ",
  "\u2018early harvest\u2019 ,w hich is that any agreement will require dropping of tariff lines on certain ",
  "product lines immediately on signing of thea greement.",
  "The third, it is difficult to establish tangible welfare gains under regional trading. Any ",
  "trading has two aspects, trade creation and trade diversion. Trade creation happens if a high ",
  "cost domestic input is replaced by globally the \u2018lowest\u2019 cost input. Trade diversion happens ",
  "when a high cost domestic input is replaced by a lower cost input from a member country, ",
  "which may not be the lowest in the world.",
  "In regional trading it is difficult to establish whether trade creation or diversion is taking ",
  "place. Regional trading does allowr for expansion of trade but whether this expansion is ",
  "better than trading with the ROW is not conclusively established.",
  "The fourth is the contentious issue of establishing what is known as \u2018Rules of Origin\u2019 ",
  "(ROO), which is how to establish that a good being traded with a member country has ",
  "originated in the member country. This is becoming increasingly complex to resolve with ",
  "emergence of global companies operating out of multiple locations, many of them housed ",
  "in members of various trading blocs. The ROOs may well dilute the entire concept of ",
  "regional trading.",
  "The experience of various trading blocs in the world has been mixed and difficult to ",
  "quantify other than that the trade has increased.",
  "The other aspect also established has been that countries with large intra-regional trade ",
  "have also seen increased multilateral trade at the same time. It has also been established ",
  "that regional trading is only better than no trading.",
  "What has not been established is that is this a better option than trading on a multilateral ",
  "platform?308 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Should Regional Trading Be Promoted?",
  "If one was to keep aside the issue of welfare gains, regional trading should be promoted ",
  "because:",
  "(1)  It is the global trend and one cannot be a silent spectator in the tide. Not swimming ",
  "with the tide would definitely imply a missed opportunity.",
  "(2)  Such blocs enable building a collective voice at the international platform, giving ",
  "bargaining strength on international matters.",
  "(3)  It sub-serves other interests of economic cooperation and cements regional ties.",
  "(4)  It can also be seen as a stepping stone of entering the global platform as it will allow ",
  "for building relative efficiency and competitive abilities.",
  "(5)  It can provide a boost to investment and tourism.",
  "Is regional trading in conflict with multilateral trading? Or does it mean that regional ",
  "trading would lose significance after consensus at WTO? There is no conflict between ",
  "regional and multilateral trading. Regional trading can co-exist with multilateral trading. In ",
  "fact, both can play a complementary role with multilateral trading providing welfare gains ",
  "to economies while regional trading to meet objectives of economic cooperation, better ",
  "regional ties, mutual betterment and a larger collective voice for them in international ",
  "matters.",
  "Even  though  both  forms  of  trading  are  around  tariffs  and  import  duties  there  is a ",
  "critical difference of regional trading is around applied\u2019 rates of tariffs while multilateral is ",
  "around \u2018bound\u2019 or the maximum rates of tariffs.",
  "India and Regional Trading",
  "India has been a rather late entrant in regional trading as many of the major agreements ",
  "were concluded in as late as 2007. India has a number of operational agreements bi-lateral ",
  "(Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, S. Korea, Bhutan, Nepal, etc.), tri-lateral (India, Brazil and South ",
  "Africa [1BSA]), and pluri-lateral agreements (ASEAN), ranging from PTAs to FTAs to ",
  "even broader areas of economic cooperation (Singapore, Thailand, Japan, S. Korea, etc.) ",
  "and even framework agreements (Bay of Bengal Initiatives for Multi Sectoral Technical ",
  "and Economic Cooperation [BIMSTEC]).",
  "While all the agreements would provide expansion of trade, two operational agreements ",
  "can be said to be the landmarks for India in terms of both markets as well as opportunities ",
  "offered. ASEAN + 3 now ASEAN + 4 (Japan, China, S. Korea and India). This has become ",
  "operational from 1 January 2010.",
  "India has agreed to drop tariff lines to zero across 4000 products within six years. Ihe ",
  "sensitive list on which there would be no reduction has been pruned down to only four ",
  "hundred  and  eighty-nine  products.  This  agreement  alone  has  the  potential  to  increase ",
  "trade by over USD 50 billion over the next decade or so.REGIONAL TRADING BLOCS 309",
  "The other is the IBSA which has the potential to provide newer markets in African and ",
  "Latin American countries. India in the last few years has been fairly aggressive in concluding ",
  "agreements conscious of the fact that it has been a late entrant and not to miss the bus.",
  "It  has  taken  a  different  line  of  trading  of  moving  away  from  conventional  global ",
  "\u2018vertical trading\u2019 into a \u2018horizontal\u2019 or deeper levels of regional trading. Global trading ",
  "is around goods and tariffs while India as part of horizontal trading has gone beyond ",
  "goods of trade in services and also areas of economic cooperation through comprehensive ",
  "economic  agreements  (CECA)  and  comprehensive  economic  partnership  agreements ",
  "(CEPA). CECA is an agreement of trade in goods, the same like a FTA but an additional ",
  "agreement of willing to negotiate or open to trade in services and also explore areas of ",
  "mutual  economic  cooperation.  Once  these  areas  are  negotiated,  finalized  and  signed  it ",
  "becomes CEPA.",
  "India has CECA in different stages with Singapore, France, Australia, Japan and CEPA ",
  "with S. Korea, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong.",
  "It is in the process of finalizing a broad based trade and investment agreement (BTLA) ",
  "with the European Union which will open up entire Europe for trading.",
  "Regional trading is seen as a way to accelerate exports and at the same time establishing ",
  "better relations with member countries.",
  "It will give an opportunity to explore newer markets, new trading partners, diversified ",
  "trade, greater economic cooperation and a definite signal of its intention of making trade ",
  "an engine of growth in future.",
  "However,  openness  and  trade  are  not  only  market-driven  or  about  newer  markets ",
  "bur also the ability to penetrate by being efficient and competitive. This is the challenge ",
  "before the government, that eventually what matters, is not the markets of regional or ",
  "multilateral,  but  to  be  globally  competitive.  That  is,  where  reforms  have  helped  but ",
  "require far greater aggression in reforms to truly establish India as a globally competitive ",
  "economy.",
  "31.2 PREFERENTIAL TRADE AGREEMENTS",
  "Preferential  Trade  Agreements  (PTAs)  have  been  proliferating,  especially  since  the ",
  "establishment  of  the  World  Trade  Organisation  (WTO)  in  1994.  As  of  1st  December ",
  "2015, the WTO had received notifications of no less than 619 PTAs (disaggregated by ",
  "goods, services, or accessions), of which 413 were already in force. Between 2008 and ",
  "2012, PTAs grew at an average year-on-year rate of 24 percent.",
  "Five forms of PTAs,, with subsequent arrangement being a deeper form of integration, ",
  "requiring more coordination and a greater loss of autonomy are:",
  "\u2022  Partial Scope Agreement (PSA) is only partial in scope, allows for trade between ",
  "countries on a small number of goods.",
  "\u2022  A free trade agreement is a preferential arrangement in which members reduce tariffs ",
  "on trade among themselves, while maintaining their own tariff rates for trade with ",
  "nonmembers.310 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "A customs union (CU) is a free-trade agreement in which members apply a common ",
  "external tariff (CET) schedule to imports from non members.",
  "common marketisacus to m sunion w heremovem entoffacto rs ofprod uc tion is",
  ">",
  "relatively free amongst member countries.",
  "An economic union is a common market where member countries coordinate macro- ",
  "economic and exchange rate policies.",
  "India and Free-Trade Agreements",
  "In addition to its long-standing commitment to multilateralism under WTO agreements ",
  "and in line with global trends, India has made use of FTAs as a key component of its ",
  "trade and foreign policy, especially from 2003-04 onwards. India has mainly focused on ",
  "partnering  with  other  Asian  countries,  and  in  goods more so  than in services. Within ",
  "Asia, India has signed bilateral FTAs with SriLanka (1998), Afghanistan (2003), Thailand ",
  "(2004), Singapore (2005), Bhutan (2006), Nepal (2009), Korea (2009), Malaysia (2011) ",
  "and Japan (2011). There have also been two regional trade agreements, the South Asian ",
  "Free  Trade  Agreement  (SAFTA,  2004)  and  the  India-Association  of  Southeast  Asian ",
  "Nations Agreement (ASEAN, 2010). Outside Asia, FTAs have been agreed with Chile ",
  "(2006) and MERCOSUR (2004) .There is varing degree of depth of integration offered by ",
  "these FTAs both in goods and services.",
  "31.3 INDIA'SEXPERIEN  CEWITHREG IONA LTRADEAG  REEME NTS",
  "India\u2019s  experience  with  Regional  Trade  Agreements  (RTAs)  have  become  increasingly ",
  "prevalent since the early 1990s. RTAs cover more than half of international trade and ",
  "operate  alongside  global  multilateral  agreements  under  WTO.  As  of  now,  around  400 ",
  "RTAs are in force globally. 14 RTAs are in force in India with a dozen more under ",
  "negotiation.",
  "Regional Trade Agreements today go beyond tariff cuts in trade in goods and incorporate ",
  "various other components like liberalization in services, investment etc. India\u2019s experience ",
  "with respect to some comprehensive agreements can be summed up in the following ways",
  "\u2022  India\u2019s  exports  to  FTA  countries  have  not  outperformed  overall  export  growth  or ",
  "exports to rest of the world.",
  "\u2022  FTAs have led to increased imports and exports, although the former has been greater",
  "\u2022  India\u2019s trade deficit with ASEAN, Korea and Japan has widened post-FTAs",
  "\u2022  According to Economic Survey 2016-17, FTAs have had a bigger impact on metals on ",
  "the importing side and textiles on the exporting side.",
  "\u2022  A 10% percent reduction in FTA tariffs for metals increases imports by 1.4 %",
  "\u2022  India\u2019s exports arc much more responsive to income changes as compared to price ",
