  "EXTERNAL DEBT OF INDIA",
  "EXTERNAL DEBT",
  "The external debt comprises of all foreign currency denominated debt owed by the central ",
  "and state governments, Indian companies and the Indian residents. As economies follow ",
  "open policies, external debt becomes an important parameter to track down given their ",
  "sensitivity and ability to service them, as in the absence of their servicing, would imply ",
  "more foreign currency borrowings for servicing the debt.",
  "As per the standard practice, India\u2019s external debt data are disseminated on a quarterly ",
  "basis with a lag of one quarter. Statistics for the first two quarters of the calendar year ",
  "(ending March and June) are compiled and released by the Reserve Bank of India, while ",
  "the data for the last two quarters (ending September and December) are compiled and ",
  "released by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. In addition, the Government ",
  "of  India  brings  out  an  annual  Status  Report  on  External  Debt  that  contains  detailed ",
  "analysis of external debt position of the country.",
  "At end-March 2018, India\u2019s external debt witnessed an increase of 12.4 per cent over its ",
  "level at end-March 2017 and placed at USS 529.7 billion. The increase is due to primarily ",
  "on account of an increase in commercial borrowings, short-term debt and non-resident ",
  "Indian (NRI) deposits. The increase in the magnitude of external debt was partly due to ",
  "valuation loss resulting from the depreciation of the US dollar against major currencies. ",
  "The external debt to GDP ratio stood at 20.5 per cent at end-March 2018, higher than its ",
  "level of 20.0 per cent at end-March 2017.",
  "It is not the quantum of borrowings which is important but how they are being utilized ",
  "or are they generating sufficient returns to pay the interest and earning sufficient to repay ",
  "the principal. This is what is meant by \u2018debt servicing\u2019. As long as debt is \u2018serviceable\u2019 any ",
  "amount of debt is \u2018sustainable\u2019.",
  "How do we measure external debt serviceability? This is measured through foreign ",
  "currency received not as debt but through inflows on the \u2018balance in current account\u2019 of ",
  "BOP. That is, through exports of goods and services and also other inflows such as inward ",
  "remittances and inward tourism or inflows which are not debt creating or reversible in ",
  "nature.",
  "This is seen in relation to the debt liability in a year. Whatever the debt component, ",
  "some amount as interest and also part payment of the principal would have to be paid284 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "every year. Suppose inflows on the current account are USD 100 million and outflows on ",
  "account of interest liability is USD 20 million and if the loan is repayable in five years it ",

  "28.2 INDIA'S EXTERNAL DEBT HIGHLIGHTS",
  "As per the standard practice, India\u2019s external debt statistics are released with a lag of one ",
  "quarter.  The  major  developments relating to India\u2019s external debt as at end-September ",
  "2018 are presented below.",
  "Highlights",
  "At end-September 2018, India\u2019s external debt witnessed a decline of 3.6 per cent over ",
  "its level at end-March 2018, on account of a decrease in commercial borrowings and ",
  "non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits. The decrease in the magnitude of external debt was ",
  "primarily due to valuation gains resulting from the appreciation of the US dollar against ",
  "the Indian rupee and major currencies. The external debt to GDP ratio stood at 20.8 per ",
  "cent at end-September 2018, higher than its level of 20.5 per cent at end-March 2018. ",
  "(The ratio is based on external debt and GDP valued in rupee terms.)",
  "Major  highlights  pertaining  to  India\u2019s  external  debt  at  end-September  2018  are ",
  "presented below:",
  "\u2022  At  end-September  2018,  India\u2019s  external  debt  was  placed  at  USS  510.4  billion, ",
  "recording a decrease of USS 19.3 billion over its level at end-March 2018 .",
  "\u2022  Valuation gains due to the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Indian rupee ",
  "and major currencies (viz., SDR, yen, euro, and pound sterling) were placed at USS ",
  "25.4 billion. Excluding the valuation effect, the increase in external debt would have ",
  "been USS 6.1 billion instead of a decrease of USS 19.3 billion at end- September ",
  "2018 over end-March 2018.",
  "\u2022  Commercial borrowings continued to be the largest component of external debt with ",
  "a share of 37.1 per cent, followed by NRI deposits (23.9 per cent) and short- term ",
  "trade credit (19.9 per cent).",
  "\u2022  At end-September 2018, long-term debt (with original maturity of above one year) ",
  "was placed at USS 406.1 billion, recording a decline of USS 21.4 billion over its level ",
  "at end-March 2018.",
  "\u2022  The  share  of  long-term  debt  (original  maturity)  in  total  external  debt  at  end- ",
  "September 2018 was 79.6 per cent, lower than its level of 80.7 per cent at end- ",
  "March 2018.",
  "\u2022  The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total ",
  "external debt increased to 20.4 per cent at end-September 2018 from 19.3 per cent ",
  "at end-March 2018. The ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to foreignEXTERNAL DEBT OF INDIA 285",
  "exchange reserves increased to 26.1 per cent at end-September 2018 (24.1 per cent at ",
  "end-March 2018).",
  "\u2022  Short-term debt on a residual maturity basis (i.e., debt obligations that include ",
  "long-term debt by original maturity falling due over the next twelve months and short\u00ad",
  "term debt by original maturity) constituted 43.8 per cent of total external debt at ",
  "end-September 2018 (42.0 per cent at end-March 2018) and stood at 55.8 per cent ",
  "of foreign exchange reserves (52.3 per cent at end-March 2018) (Table 2).",
  "\u2022  US dollar denominated debt continued to be the largest component of India\u2019s external ",
  "debt with a share of 49.7 per cent at end-September 2018, followed by the Indian ",
  "rupee (36.1 per cent), SDR (5.3 per cent), yen (4.7 per cent) and euro (3.2 per cent).",
  "\u2022  The borrower-wise classification shows that the outstanding debt of both government ",
  "and non-governmcnt sectors decreased at end-September 2018 (Table 3).",
  "\u2022  Debt service payments declined to 6.5 per cent of current receipts at end- September ",
  "2018 as compared with 7.5 per cent at end-March 2018 (Table 4) - reflecting lower ",
  "repayments of external commercial borrowings.",
  "Conclusion",
  "India\u2019s external debt has remained within manageable limits as indicated by the external ",
  "debt  indicators,  and  the  country  is  not  among  the  world\u2019s  top  debtors  .  The  prudent ",
  "external debt management policy of the government has helped contain the rise in external ",
  "debt and maintaining a comfortable external debt debt position.",
  "International comparison based on World Bank\u2019s \u2018International Debt Statistics 2017\u2019 ",
  "indicates that India continues to be among the less vulnerable nations and India\u2019s main ",
  "external debt indicators compare well with other indebted developing countries. India\u2019s ",
  "key  debt indicators,  especially external debt to GNI, debt service ratio and short-term ",
  "debt to total external debt continue to be comfortable indicating that our external debt is ",
  "within manageable limits. Among developing countries, while China has the highest debt ",
  "stock and the highest share of short term external debt to total external debt, its key debt ",
  "indicators like total external debt to GNI, debt service ratio and foreign exchange cover for ",
  "external debt are more favourable than the other developing countries.",
  "Public Debt of India",
  "While India can draw comfort levels in terms of external debt, India also has a deeper ",
  "internal problem of the high levels of rupee denominated debt comprising of government ",
  "borrowings,  petro  oil  bonds,  etc.  This  taken  together  with  external  debt  is  known  as ",
  "\u2018public  debt\u2019.  Public  debt  to  GDP  ratio  has  continuously  increased  reaching  almost ",
  "70 per cent.",
  "A striking difference in the overall public debt of India in relation to other economies ",
  "having similar magnitude of public debt is the fact that in India internal debt accounts 286 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "for 90 per cent of public debt while external debt is only 10 per cent. In other similar ",
  "economies, the component of external debt was of much higher levels making them more ",
  "susceptible to crisis than India.",
  "Though  high  internal  debt  is  preferable  to  high  external  debt  but  not  without  its ",
  "implications on domestic liquidity, inflation ultimately threatening long-term sustainability ",
  "of growth. The government has made conscious efforts at fiscal consolidation but the crisis ",
  "has taken its own toll in terms of fiscal concessions, increased levels of deficit to prevent ",
  "the slowdown of growth. This may be understandable but the bigger challenge for the ",
  "government would be to balance investment needs to increase growth rates and at the ",
  "same time to keep deficits under check. This is easier said than done.",
