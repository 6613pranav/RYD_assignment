  "MULTILATERAL FINANCIAL",
  "INSTITUTIONS",
  "INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF)",
  "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WB) are multilateral ",
  "financial institutions having their genesis in the Bretton Wood Conference during 1944. ",
  "The IMF was set up, first for post-war reconstruction and for greater economic cooperation ",
  "amongst the countries. Subsequently, its role changed to achieve exchange rate stability of ",
  "different economies.",
  "Its  role  since  1970  onwards  was  to  provide  loans  to  economies  battling  on  their ",
  "respective balance of payments front arising out of the collapse of the fixed exchange rates ",
  "system, oil shocks and also to those economies opening up as part of global integration but ",
  "having structural problems on their trade front.",
  "Availing loan facilities from the IMF requires membership, (presently 189 members) ",
  "by buying a \u2018quota\u2019 usually in relation to the output of economies and their stature in the ",
  "world. The quota in turn determines voting rights for various policy decisions including ",
  "loans to be provided to the affected economies by the IMF. The quota is bought by paying ",
  "25 per cent in any of the Widely Accepted Currency (WAC) comprising of the USD, ",
  "Euro, Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. The remaining 75 per cent can be bought in ",
  "the home currency and maintained with the central bank of that country but cannot be ",
  "withdrawn without authorization from the IMF.",
  "All loan facilities are short-term, provide interim relief and are linked as a percentage to ",
  "the quota, which carry commercial interest rate with varying repayment periods and strict ",
  "conditionalities like reforms in the domestic sector for long-term structural adjustment. ",
  "All the accounts of the IMF are maintained in a neutral accounting currency known as ",
  "\u2018special drawing rights (SDR)\u2019 also referred as paper gold\u2019. SDRs can be converted into ",
  "any WAC at predetermined rates by the IMF.",
  "Special drawing right is not a currency but only an accounting unit of the IMF and ",
  "the quota can also be purchased in SDRs. IMF besides lending for trade imbalances and ",
  "currency-related  issues  of  economies  also  publishes  country  papers  for  use  by  various ",
  "governments for qualitative improvements in policy-making.",
  "They  are  also  playing  an  important  role  along  with  the  World  Bank  Group  for ",
  "eradication  of  absolute  poverty  especially  in  Asian  and  African  countries  through  its ",
  "programmes like poverty reduction growth fund (PRGF), which is the only concessional MULTILATERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 277",
  "assistance programme of the IMF repayable over ten years. IMF has been criticized for ",
  "the large dominance of the US and its interest at the IMF is driven by a \u2018Washington ",
  "Consensus, being the largest quota holder.",
  "IMF Resources",
  "Most resources for IMF loans are provided by member countries, primarily through their ",
  "payment of quotas.",
  "\u2022  Quotas: Quota subscriptions are a central component of the IMF\u2019s financial resources. ",
  "Each member country of the IMF is assigned a quota, based broadly on its relative ",
  "position in the world economy.",
  "\u2022  Special Drawing Rights (SDR): The SDR is an international reserve asset, created by ",
  "the IMF in 1969 to supplement its member countries\u2019 official reserves.",
  "\u2022  Gold: Gold remains an important asset in the reserve holdings of several countries, ",
  "and the IMF is still one of the worlds largest official holders of gold.",
  "Recent Trends at the International Monetary Fund (IMF)",
  "With  the  rebalancing  amongst  the  global economies,  emergence  of  BRICS economies, ",
  "with their increasing contribution to the world output, a need was also felt to realign ",
  "the quotas of the IMF by giving them larger share, commensurate with their growing ",
  "international  stature  and  contribution  to  the  global  output.  BRIC  economies  have  thus ",
  "been allocated 6 per cent additional quotas, with India\u2019s share in voting rights increasing ",
  "from 2.3 to 2.6 per cent, making it the eighth highest quota holder and voting rights from ",
  "the earlier eleventh highest quota holder.",
  "In terms of quota and voting rights, India ranks behind US, Japan, China, Germany, ",
  "France, UK and Italy but ranks ahead of Russia and Brazil, amongst the top ten quota ",
  "holders at the IMF. The rebalancing has doubled the total quota to SDR 477 billion or ",
  "USD 756 billion.",
  "Post-global crisis, IMF is likely to have a large role in revival but more importantly, ",
  "functions  as  a  true  multilateral  financial  institution  providing  greater  global  financial ",
  "stability from its present role of currency management. Since, its coming into existence, ",
  "for the first time IMF has also opened a different window, new arrangement to borrow ",
  "(NAB), for crisis ridden economies in the euro zone. This functionality would require ",
  "greater  inter-government  monetary  co-operation,  greater  transparency  in  functioning  of ",
  "monetary authorities and the IMF would have to take the lead role.",
  "IMF REFORMS",
  "IMF  Launches  New  SDR  Basket  Including  Chinese  Renminbi,  Determines  New ",

  "at the average exchange rates for the three-month period ending today (July 1 through ",
  "September 30, 2016), the share of each currency in the value of the SDR corresponds to ",

  "International Monetary Fund (IMF) and India",
  "India has been major  borrower  of  the  IMF  before  the  reforms  were  initiated.  The ",
  "borrowings had been from various facilities of the IMF. However, all the loans taken by ",
  "India have not only been \u2018repaid but prepaid\u2019 to the IMF and our present outstanding is ",
  "nil. The IMF also has a financial transaction plan (FTP) which is a plan to help the BOP of ",
  "impoverished low income countries and only forty-seven strong economies are permitted ",
  "to lend to the IMF for funding this plan.",
  "India has also been admitted as a lender to the IMF for this plan since 2002. The ",
  "amount contributed towards the plan is taken as a part of foreign exchange reserves of the ",
  "country. So far, the contribution made by India to the FTP is USD 205 million.",
  "Probably  India  would  be  the  only  country  in  the  world  to  have  become  a  lender ",
  "(creditor) to the IMF, from being a borrower (debtor) just two decades ago. It is also an ",
  "acknowledgement by the IMF of the strong fundamentals, maturity and growing stature ",
  "of India post-reforms. With the increased quota and voting rights India will now find a ",
  "greater, say, in various policy decisions at the IMF.",

  "Gradually,  the  emphasis  was  shifted  to  development  oriented  for  developing  countries ",
