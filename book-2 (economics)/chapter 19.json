  "LOOKING OUTWARD\u2014",
  "TOWARDS GLOBALIZATION",
  "So  far,  we  have  discussed  about  the  domestic  economy.  What  does  it  mean  to  look ",
  "outward? Looking outward is to look at the Rest of World.",
  "19.1 NEED TO LOOK OUTWARD",
  "The need to look outward brings us to the importance of trade and various currencies. ",
  "Any trade with other countries would involve receipts and payment in currencies other ",
  "than home currency. As an inward looking economy focused on domestic sector, the home ",
  "currency was important. Trade will involve imports (goods coming into the country) and ",
  "exports (goods going outside the country). All payment for imports has to be in foreign ",
  "currency and all receipts in foreign currency.",
  "The need to look outwards thus is to look for newer markets and at the same time ",
  "allowing foreign currency to come to pay for imports, required for developmental needs ",
  "domestically.",
  "19.2 NEED FOR IMPORTS AND EXPORTS",
  "It is well-known that there are different countries in the world with different resource ",
  "endowments, levels of development, income levels, diverse languages and cultures. No one ",
  "country can be said to have the best of everything in the world i.c., there is a 'relative deficit' ",
  "in each country which could either be resources, or people, or knowledge or technology ",
  "or markets or even goodsa nd servicesd iffering in termso fth eirra ngean d superiority.",
  "T he needs of ac ountry keep on changing continuously .It also undergoes  a change with ",
  "increasing population pressure  and increased income  levels ,requiring optimal  and efficient ",
  "allocation and utilization  o fscarce  resources depending  on the resource endowments of ",
  "different countries.",
  "Basically, there are two different kinds of resource endowments in an economy\u2014labour ",
  "and capital, This is 'relative resource endowment' i.e., though every country will have both ",
  "but relatively one would be more than the other across countries. India, for example, has ",
  "relatively large and abundant pool of labour than capital. Similarly Germany has relatively ",
  "more capital than labour. Thus, labour would be cheap in India, whereas capital would be ",
  "cheap in Germany.",
  "Thus, production process in India would be labour-intensive and such goods would ",
  "be cheaper in India. What about labour-intensive goods in Germany? They will be more ",
  "expensive given their relative scarcity and higher cost of labour in comparison with India.216 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "What abo ut cap ital-intensive goo ds? The  sam e, it w  il l be che aper to  produce cap ital-  ",
  "intensive goo ds in  Germany given their rela tive abu ndance of  cap ital tha n India whe re  ",
  "capitalissc ar ce.",
  "Thus, Ind ia pro ducing capital-intensive goo ds and  Germany producing labour-intensive  ",
  "goods is n ot effi cient util ization of reso urces, sub -optimal and  resulting in higher cos t in  ",
  "both economies.Thu s,then eed  arisesfort rad eand  to look outwardsfora n e conomy.",
  "A bett er solu tion for both  the cou ntries, Ind ia as  wel l as  Ger many would be that : le:   ",
  "India pro duce labo ur-intensive goo ds (as it i s r ela tively cheaper in  India) and  export to  ",
  "Germany while imp ort cap ital-intensive goo ds from  Ger many (as it i s r ela tively cheaper  ",
  "in Germany).",
