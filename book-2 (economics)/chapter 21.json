  "INDIA AND ",
  "GLOBALIZATION",
  "21.1. TR ADESTRATEGIES",
  "We have previously discussed about concepts and objectives of globalization. But how did ",
  "India go forward? Firstly, it was the Economic Reforms of 1991, which liberalized inflows ",
  "of goods and services and also capital inflows as a signal of gradual and calibrated opening ",
  "of the economy and at the same time a distinct thrust and focus on promotion of exports ",
  "not that of surpluses\u2019 but catering to the global market in terms of demand, tastes and ",
  "preferences.",
  "As a strategy to promote exports there are two textbook strategies one which is the ",
  "export-led growth\u2019 strategy and the other as the \u2018growth-led exports\u2019 strategy. An export- ",
  "led growth strategy is of recent origin in the nineties, resulting out of the experience of the ",
  "South-east Asian economies essentially comprising of Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea ",
  "and Indonesia in the late eighties and early nineties. They were hailed as the Asian tigers'.",
  "In a short span of time, they were able to accelerate the rate of growth, increase per ",
  "capita  income  providing  for  all  round  development  of  such  economies,  by  a  distinct ",
  "openness, liberal foreign investment and a strong focus on exports. Thus, the strategy of ",
  "exports increasing overall growth rates in such economies in a very short time, were also ",
  "known as \u2018butterfly economies\u2019 which is smaller economies ability to grow and expand ",
  "income at a fast pace in short time frame.",
  "This strategy subsequently got questioned by the crisis which struck these economies ",
  "in the late nineties, as \u2018contagion effect\u2019 (spreading across all these economics) plunging ",
  "them into currency crisis\u2019. That is, complete erosion of faith in home currency (it will be ",
  "discussed later).",
  "It may be premature at this stage to say whether openness or the strategy was flawed ",
  "bur sufficei tto  sa yher ethat itwa sn eithe rtheop enne ssnorthe  strat egyf ollowed butfromo ther ",

  "from  thecountr y.      ",
  "However, this is possible for smaller and homogeneous economies, lesser pressures of ",
  "population or regional imbalances, lesser structural rigidities, relatively greater flexibility ",
  "for such transformation. Larger economies like India given the size, large agrarian base, ",
  "diversity, intense population pressure, large-scale poverty and unemployment, regionalGOING FORWARD\u2014INDIA AND GLOBALIZATION 227",
  "imbalances, structural rigidities and inflexibilities make such  a strategy neither feasible.",
  "appropriate nor desirable.",
  "The  other  growth-led  export  strategy  is  more  relevant  for  economies  like  India.  A ",
  "strategy also followed by the developed countries in the previous years. This strategy is ",
  "slow, time-consuming but sustainable in the long run. It allows for growth to increase by ",
  "expansion of the manufacturing sector, allowing for their maturity and gradually emerging ",
  "as  competitive,  finding  foothold  in  global  markets  and  thus  increasing  merchandise ",
  "(goods) exports.",
  "Such a strategy also provides an incentive mechanism for the natural growth of export- ",
  "oriented  industries  well-integrated  with  the  domestic  economy.  Both  India  as  well  as ",
  "China have, however, blended both export-led growth and growth-led exports, as their ",
  "strategy in their efforts at globalization.",
  "Both  have  dedicated  certain  geographies  within  the  domestic  economy  to  cater ",
  "exclusively for exports as part of export-led growth strategy and the remaining part of the ",
  "economy following the growth-led export strategy. It is no longer the question about the ",
  "strategy to adopt but that economies have to have a distinct openness and exports both ",
  "integral to growth of economies in future.",
  "BRANDING INDIA THROUGH 'MAKE IN INDIA'",
  "The Gol is working under 6P protocol to make project branding a success, these 6P s are ",
  "explained as under:",
  "Program",
  "In  persuit  of  branding  India  like  other  developing  economies  has  done  in  the  World, ",
  "in  this  direction  the  Indian  Prime  Minister  Narendra  Modi  launched  the  Make  in ",
  "India initiative on September 25, 2014, with the primary goal of making India a global ",
  "manufacturing  hub,  by  encouraging  both  multinational  as  well  as  domestic  companies ",
  "to manufacture their products within the country. Led by the Department of Industrial ",
  "Policy and Promotion, the initiative aims to raise the contribution of the manufacturing ",
  "sector to 25% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by die year 2025 from its current ",
  "16%.  Make  in  India  has  introduced  multiple  new  initiatives,  promoting  foreign  direct ",
  "investment,  implementing  intellectual  property  rights  and  developing  the  manufacturing ",
  "sector. It targets 25 sectors of the economy which range from automobile to Information ",
  "Technology (IT) and Business Process Management (BPM), the details of each can be ",
  "viewed on the official site (www.makeinindia.com). It also seeks to facilitate job creation, ",
  "foster  innovation,  enhance  skill  development  and  protect  intellectual  property.  The ",
  "logo of \u2018Make in India\u2019 - a lion made of gear wheels - itself reflects the integral role of ",
  "manufacturing in governments vision and national development.",
  "Process",
  "Make  in  India  is  much  more  than  an  inspiring  and  energising  slogan.  It  represents  a ",

  "Partnerships",
  "The Make in India initiative has been built on layers of collaborative effort of DIPP, ",
  "acting as a backbone with Union Ministers, Secretaries to the Government of India, state ",
  "governments, industry leaders, and various knowledge partners to debate and formulate an ",
