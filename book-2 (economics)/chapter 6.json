  "6.11 'WHY' IS AGRICULTURE SECTOR IMPORTANT",
  "FOR INDIA?",
  "In the previous section, we had dealt about agriculture sector which has about 60 per cent ",
  "plus  population-dependence,  an  aspect  which  has  been  there  since  Independence.  This ",
  "sector provides us with food security and raw material for manufacturing sector.",
  "Each and every country would like to be self-sufficient for its requirements of food ",
  "grains, pulses, sugar, edible oils, milk, fruits and vegetables.",
  "India has the largest number of villages of over 6,00,000. Majority of our population ",
  "resides in villages. No other country has so many villages.",
  "India\u2019s agricultural sector is characterized by traditional, subsistence and livelihood, ",
  "rain fed farming, food grain oriented, lacking in diversification and commercialization. ",
  "Over 80 per cent of the farmers are landless, small and marginal farmers with cultivation ",
  "for consumption and little diversification. Agricultural finance is informal with reliance ",
  "on the money lenders. It is said about India that majority of our economic issues are ",
  "primarily of poverty and unemployment and both the problems and their resolution lie ",
  "in the agricultural sector.",
  "There is enough literature available on agriculture in standard text books on Indian ",
  "Economy. It would be suffice to say here that the key issues in agriculture are to increase ",
  "production through distinct improved productivity.",
  "'Why' is Productivity Important?",
  "In the earlier years, production could be increased by bringing in more and more land ",
  "under  cultivation  without  addressing  productivity.  However,  today  all  available  arable ",
  "land is already under cultivation which means production can be increased only through ",
  "increased productivity.",

  "Pink  revolution  primarily  referred  as  for  onion,  prawns  and  pharma  industry,  but  the ",
  "2nd  generation  pink  revolution  focusing  on  modernisation  of  meat  and  poultry  has ",
  "attained the number 1 position in the world in exports of buffalo meat in 2012, exporting ",
  "approximately 1.5 million metric tons of beef, according to the United States Department ",
  "of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service. The major importers are from Middle ",
  "East and South East Asia countries. Further, it was also found that the broiler meat (i.e. ",
  "chicken) sector has witnessed a 30 percent growth rate since the year 2009, at the same ",
  "time it is placed amongst the fastest growing sectors in the Indian economy at a rate of ",
  "8 percent. This increase has been largely attributable to growing domestic demand. The ",
  "Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has acknowledged India\u2019s potential ",
  "and effective measures towards \u2018pink revolution\u2019 by fostering modernization of its meat ",
  "and poultry processing units. Accordingly, in a report titled the \u2018Indian Meat Industry ",
  "Perspective\u2019, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has recommended ",
  "an outlined four steps framework that India must adopt and adhere to it for the success of ",
  "pink revolution are as follows:",
  "1. Setting up state of the art meat processing plants;",
  "2.  Developing technologies to raise male buffalo calves for meat production;",
  "3.  Increasing the number of farmers rearing buffalo under contractual farming;",
  "4.  Establishing disease-free zones for rearing animals.",
  "Environmental and Health Hazards",
  "Although, the robust performance of the sector is too lucrative but at the same time there ",
  "are some environmental riders to be borne in mind. As per an article being published in ",
  "Environmental Science and Technology Journal, titled \u2018Food-miles and the relative climate ",
  "impacts of food choices in the US\u2019, the data shows United States red meat production ",
  "accounts for 30 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions so created while poultry and ",
  "dairy contribute 28 percent of emissions. Thus, now we can cannot be ignorant with the ",
  "fact that India is now largest exporter of meat in the world which will in turn pointing ",
  "at the level of green house gas emission. Another vital area of concern is the managing ",
  "risk  w.r.t.  meat  borne  pathogens  like  E.coli,  Salmonella,  Campylobacter,  Listeria  and ",
  "Yesinia, also at the same time other diseases of concern to public health, and the control ",
  "of pesticide residues.52 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Potential and challenges of Pink Revolution in India",
  "Growth Potentials",
  "\u2022  To increase present meat consumption per capita of 6 grams approx, per day to 50 ",
  "grams a day in the next decade or so.",
  "\u2022  India accounts only 2 percent approx of global market in light of large live stock count",
  "\u2022  Growing rate is varying between range of between 8-15 per cent annually, and is now ",
  "worth more than 700 billion dollars.",
  "Challenges",
  "\u2022  Drafting  of  standard  policies  for  the  sector  w.r.t.  meat  production  and  export, ",
  "standardizing  the  quality  and  safety  aspects  of  meat  and  poultry,  and  creating ",
  "infrastructure facilities for modern slaughter houses, meat testing facilities and cold ",
  "storages for the growth of the meat and poultry processing sector.",
  "\u2022  Implementation of 4 areas highlighted by FAO of UN",
  "\u2022  Better hygienic methods required in meat and poultry processing",
  "\u2022  Channelizing of increased and high volume of investment s in the sector.",
  "Government Policies",
  "\u2022  No income tax or central excise.",
  "\u2022  No  restrictions imposed  upon the  export  of  poultry  and  poultry products, and the ",
  "government provides some transport subsidiaries.",
  "\u2022  100 per cent FDI is being permitted to tap into available opportunities across the ",
  "sector.",
  "\u2022  Comprehensive scheme being launched for the modernization of abattoirs across the ",
  "country  in  order  to  address  quality  standards,  contamination  and  deterioration  of ",
  "produce, and the amount of meat wasted.",
  "More recently, Rainbow Revolution (includes horticulture comprising of fruits, vegetables, ",
  "floriculture, plantation crops, spices, etc.).",
  "India is one among the largest producers of various agricultural goods in terms of area ",
  "under cultivation and production; however, it clearly lags behind in the productivity in all ",
  "major crops which is not sufficient for the domestic market as is evident in their increasing ",
  "prices. It is not sufficient enough to be satisfied as the largest producer of pulses, coconut, ",
  "ginger, turmeric, pepper, milk or even the fact that India is the second largest producer of ",
  "rice, wheat, ground nut, fruits and vegetables. It has to be seen in relation to the relative ",
  "domestic demand and productivity rather than only production.",
  "India is blessed with large land area whereas, China has lesser arable land than us but ",
  "its agricultural production is double than that of India. Clearly, productivity is the chief ",
  "differentiator between India and China.",
  "Another  concern  is  that  the  average  annual  growth  of  agricultural  production  right ",
  "since Independence has been only 2.5 per cent. This is very low keeping in view the ",
  "domestic  needs.  Food  grains  output  has  been  trapped  between  175  and  200  million ",
  "tonnes of which wheat has stagnated around 70 million tonnes in the last few years. There AGRICULTURE SECTOR 53",
  "is  an  urgent  requirement  to  increase  the  production  which  can  happen  only  with  the ",
  "increased productivity.",
  "Growth in agricultural production is seen as a multiplier for the rest of the economy ",
  "as it helps in augmenting supply of food products thereby cooling prices. It also increases ",
  "income of the farmers and thus greater demand for non-agricultural goods giving incentive ",
  "to the industrial sector to produce more and provide an upward spiral in growth.",
  "6.3 NEW AGRICULTURAL POLICY 2000",
  "The government realizing the importance of the agriculture sector formulated the New ",
  "Agricultural Policy during 2000, which has tried to give a new direction to the agriculture ",
  "sector which has the following salient features:",
  "\u2022   Agricultur e secto r ha s to grow  at  an average annual growth of a minimum  4 per c ent",
  "over the next few decades.",
  "\u2022  Greater  focus  has  to  be  given  on  horticulture,  animal  husbandry,  poultry,  dairy, ",
  "aquaculture given their potential and their twin ability to raise the plank of growth ",
  "and increase purchasing power.",
  "\u2022  Need to provide food and nutrition security.",
  "\u2022  There  is  a  requirement  for  greater  biotechnology  use,  newer  plant  varieties  and ",

  "AGRICULTURE EXPORT POLICY, 2018",
  "In order to provide an impetus to agricultural exports, the Government has come out with a ",
  "comprehensive \u2018Agriculture Export Policy\u201d with an aim at doubling the agricultural exports ",
  "and integrating Indian farmers and Indian products with the global value chains.54 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "The Agriculture Export Policy envisions in harnessing the export potential of Indian ",
  "agriculture to transform India as a global power in agriculture and raise farmers income.",
  "Policy Objectives",
  "\u2022  Doubling agricultural exports from present -USS 30+ Billion to -USS 60+ Billion ",
  "by 2022 and reach US$ 100 Billion in the next few years thereafter, with a sustained ",

  "\u2022  Strive to double India\u2019s share in world agri exports by integrating with global value ",
  "chain.",
  "\u2022  Enable farmers to get benefit of export opportunities from global market.",
  "RAINBOW REVOLUTION",
  "The  earlier  Green  Revolution  was  centred  on  wheat  and  now  what  is  required  is  a ",
  "comprehensive revolution, which covers the entire agriculture sector known as Rainbow ",
  "Revolution and it essentially means the following:",
  "\u2022  Agricultural  activities  to  change  from  subsistence  and  livelihood  activities to as a ",
  "commercial venture with focus on productivity and profitability.",
  "\u2022  Crop diversification, commercialization, moving up the value addition chain.",
  "\u2022  Intensification of research and should ensure their effective dissemination amongst ",
  "farmers.",
  "\u2022  Agricultural extension service, which is transmission of appropriate technology from ",
  "lab to land, has virtually collapsed in India. Less than 1 per cent of farmers make use ",
  "of the extension services (Krishi Vigyan Kendra). Block level extension services are not ",
  "equipped with the latest advancements in technology. There is an urgent requirement ",
  "of their integration in the agriculture sector to close the knowledge gap.",
  "\u2022  Allowing modern science, biotechnology, organic farming to be blended within the ",
  "agriculture sector.",
  "\u2022  Farmers to move away from two-crop cycle to shorter duration crops allowing for ",
  "multiple cropping.",
  "\u2022  Stress on completion of irrigation projects to get more and more land under irrigation.",
  "\u2022  Increase both on and off farm employment.",
  "\u2022  Focusing on rural transportation.",
  "\u2022  The farmer should become the fulcrum and efforts made to improve his standards of ",
  "living and in his prosperity, lies the prosperity of the agriculture sector and the Indian ",
  "Economy.AGRICULTURE SECTOR 55",
  "Dr M. S. Swaminathan, an agricultural economist, however, feels that India needs \u2018Ever ",
  "Green  Revolution\u2019  for  long-term  sustainability.  It  cannot  be  achieved  in  one  shot  but ",
  "continuous shots at improving production and productivity, suitable blend of the traditional ",
  "with modern, focused on locally renewable sources of energy, organic farming and making ",
  "inputs and credit available to the farmers, as fundamentally more important today.",
  "Agriculture  sector  right  since  Independence  has  been  a  thrust  area,  with  increased ",
  "investments  in  each  successive  five-year  plans,  but  problems  have  not  only  remained ",
  "unresolved but only accentuated over a period of time with large-scale rural poverty.",
  "MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE (MSP)",
  "The  government  announces  the  minimum  support  price  (MSP)  for  twenty-four  crops ",
  "including rice, wheat, pulses, sugarcane prior to harvest which is to say that the minimum ",
  "price of crops in the market would not be less than the MSP announced for the crop. Of ",
  "the  MSP  announced  for  various  crops,  the  government  through  Food  Corporation  of ",
  "India, as discussed in an earlier chapter, directly procures wheat and rice for meeting buffer ",
  "stock requirements and also to channelize the food grains to the poor through various ",
  "government sponsored schemes. For the remaining crops, the government would ensure a ",
  "price which is higher than the MSP in the market.",
  "Fruits  and  vegetables  are  sold  to  the  agriculture  produce  marketing  cooperatives ",
  "(APMC) of the respective state governments, which also fix the price keeping in view their ",
  "relative cost and also ensure the farmer obtains a fair price.",
  "The delivery channel has a number of middle men, who serve as bottlenecks and also ",
  "responsible for increased prices, large-scale hoardings and also prevents the farmer from ",
  "getting benefits of increased prices.",
  "The MSP allows a farmer knowing the price which he would get for the produce in ",
  "the market especially for the food grains, but it is also believed that the benefits largely ",
  "go to the bigger farmers, besides the MSP has prevented diversification of the agriculture ",
  "sector. Many critics have favored discontinuation  o fth eMSP, but the large scale small and ",

  "INDIAN AGRICULTURE\u2014TEN NEW THOUGHTS",
  "Agriculture sector in India requires an out-of-box thinking keeping in mind the criticality ",
  "of this sector.",
  "At first, the scientific/modem genetic engineered farming today is crucial for India\u2019s future.",
  "Secondly, the markets for the farmers are distorted, not enabling them to get the best ",
  "prices and there is a need to connect the farmer directly with the markets what is referred ",
  "as F(Farmer) \u2022 F(firm) \u2022 F(fork).",
  "At present, selling of agricultural commodities is under the APMCs of the respective ",
  "state government. Today, technology/internet provides not only for domestic access but ",
  "also for global access.56 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Farmers would need to be sensitized towards accessing those markets which get them a ",
  "better pricing. This would also do away with the inefficient middle men syndrome, which ",
  "are intermediaries with no contribution and on the contrary are largely responsible for ",
  "distorting, hoardings and other such malpractices.",
  "Third, is contract farming which also allows for direct contact of the farmer with the ",
  "market. Under this, the land is with the farmer except that production of a crop is under ",
  "a \u2018contract\u2019 with a buyer directly who also has the responsibility of providing necessary ",
  "inputs and also picking up the produce whenever ready.",
  "This will however require two critical supports from the government:",
  "\u2022  Amendments to the respective APMC of different state governments.",
  "\u2022  Enacting legislations to ensure that interest of the farmers is adequately protected. ",
  "Fourthly,  a  serious  thought  would  have  to  be  afforded  to  corporate  farming  which ",
  "allows private sector players to enter into agricultural activities. It is not true that this ",
  "step  would  lead  to  greater  marginalization  and  exploitation  of  the  small  and  marginal ",
  "farmers.",
  "There is a larger take away in the form of increased productivity, commercialization, ",
  "diversification,  greater  value-addition,  greater  and  efficient  use  of  land,  building  an ",
  "efficient  supply  chain, increased  investment and  readily  absorbed modern technologies. ",
  "Almost 40 per cent of food products are wasted and destroyed in the absence of supply ",
  "chain which can easily be plugged by the large corporates resulting in increased supply of ",
  "food products and this would lead to lower prices in the markets.",
  "Fifthly, what is required today is complete mapping of soils across the length and ",
  "breadth of the country, superimposed with historical data of the climate, rainfall, crop ",
  "suitability  and  then  decide  on  the  cropping  pattern.  Today,  technology  information  is ",
  "available  to  allow  for  soil,  climate-based  cropping  pattern  and  not  on  traditional  and ",
  "historical-based cropping pattern.",
  "Sixthly, need of growth will start to encroach upon land for setting up the special ",
  "economic zones, setting up power plants, building roads, etc., which means in future the ",
  "land available for agriculture would gradually be reduced.",
  "In  terms  of  The  National  Bureau  of  Soil  Survey  and  Land,  Government  of  India, ",
  "land under non-agriculture has increased from 3 per cent in 1950\u201451 to over 11 per ",
  "cent  presently.  This  makes  increasing  productivity  not  only  important  but  an  absolute ",
  "\u2018Must\u2019.",
  "Seventhly, there is an increasing trend amongst farmers in the belief of agriculture as ",
  "non-viable and unprofitable provided, the increasing cost of production and they exiting ",
  "by selling the land for industrial activities. In recent times, the government is also declaring ",
  "large land area as non-agriculture to support industrial growth.",
  "Herein, lies the challenges of balancing both but larger challenge would be to reestablish ",
  "agricultural activities as not only viable but also as a profitable commercial proposition.",
  "Eighth, is the land reforms which have been an avowed objective since Independence ",
  "but little has been done and still lesser achieved. There is a need for this to be prioritized by ",
  "the state governments. Further efforts should be made to computerize land records such ",
  "as the \u2018Bhoomi Project in Karnataka\u2019 and web-based land records under the \u2018Dharitree ",
  "Project in Assam\u2019. India also has large waste land area which could be given to rural AGRICULTURE SECTOR 57",

  "FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY\u2014AN OVERVIEW,",
  "   ",
  "OPPORTUNITIESANDCHALLENGES",
  "   ",
  "India'sAgrarianStrength",
  "India produces 200 million tonnes of food grains of which it is one among the largest ",
  "producers of wheat and rice. It is the second largest producer of groundnuts, fruits and ",
  "vegetables, which accounts for 10 per cent of the world\u2019s fruits production and the country ",
  "is leading in the production of mangoes and bananas. India is the world\u2019s largest producer58 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "of  milk  owing  to  the  strong  business  models  which  are  formed  through  cooperative ",
  "movements  in  the  country.  Meat  and  poultry  has  also  gained  popularity  due  to  the ",
  "emergence of producers that have integrated breeding, feed milling, contract growing and ",
  "marketing facilities which results in improved productivity. Meat, fish and poultry are in ",
  "rural areas as they are easily affordable and provide necessary nutrients.",
  "In recent years, there has been a shift from conventional farming of food grains to ",
  "horticulture which includes fruits, vegetables, ornamental crops, medicinal and aromatic ",
  "plants, spices and plantation crops including coconut, cashew nuts and cocoa and allied ",
  "activities.",
  "Nascent Food Processing",
  "Despite  the  agrarian  strength  of  production  in  India,  food  processing  industry  is  still ",
  "in  a  nascent  stage  but  holds  tremendous  potential  to  grow,  considering  the  wide- ",
  "ranging  and  large  raw  material  base  that  the  country  offers,  along  with  a  consumer ",
  "base of over one billion people. This industry holds tremendous opportunities for large ",
  "investments  and  an  untapped  market.  Even  though  India\u2019s  agricultural  production  base ",
  "is  reasonably  strong,  it  has  low productivity and is largely a livelihood activity. It  is ",
  "also characterized by high levels of wastage of over 35 per cent especially in fruits and ",
  "vegetables.",
  "Processing of fruits and vegetables is low 2 per cent, around 35 per cent in milk, ",
  "21 per cent in meat and 6 per cent in poultry products. By international comparison, ",
  "these levels are significantly low\u2014processing of agricultural produce is around 40 per cent ",
  "in China, 30 per cent in Thailand, 70 per cent in Brazil, 78 per cent in the Philippines ",
  "and 80 per cent in Malaysia. Value addition in agriculture produce in India is hardly ",
  "20 per cent.",
  "The other important aspect is organized sector which has very little presence and largely ",
  "dominated by the unorganized sector. For example, in fruits and vegetables segment over ",
  "90 per cent is by the unorganized sector.",
  "The food processing industry in India has a very small share of 1.5 per cent in the ",
  "total  GDP  of  the  country  and  as  a  part  of  total  manufacturing  accounts  for  around ",
  "9  per  cent.  India\u2019s  share  in  world  trade  in  respect  of  processed  food  is  only  about ",
  "1.6 per cent.",
  "Potential of the Food Processing Industry",
  "The Indian food industry is poised for a huge growth, increasing its contribution to world ",
  "food trade every year. In India, the food sector has emerged as a high-growth and high- ",
  "profit sector due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food ",
  "processing industry.",
  "The food industry, which is currently valued at USS 39.71 billion, is expected to grow ",
  "at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11 per cent to US$65.4 billion by ",

  "Mega Food Park Scheme",
  "Highest  priority  has  been  accorded  by  the  government  for  the  development  of ",
  "infrastructure. The government has already taken several initiatives on this front which ",
  "include  developing  of  food  parks,  packaging  centres,  modernized  abattoirs,  integrated ",
  "cold chain facilities, irradiation facilities and value added centres.",
  "The initiative to develop food parks was taken primarily in order to assist the small ",
  "and medium enterprises which are unable to invest in capital intensive activities. So far, ",
  "twenty-two food parks have come into operation which provide common facilities such as ",
  "cold storage, food testing and analysis labs.64 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "The primary objective of the MFPS is to provide adequate/excellent infrastructure facilities ",
  "for food processing along the value chain from the farm to market. It will include creation ",
  "of infrastructure near the farm, transportation, logistics and centralized processing centres.",
  "The main feature of the scheme is a cluster-based approach. The scheme will be demand- ",
  "driven; pre-marketed and would facilitate food processing units to meet environmental, ",
  "safety  and  social  standards.  The  expected  outcome  results  in  increased  realization  for ",
  "farmers,  creation  of  high  quality  rural  processing  infrastructure,  reduction  in  wastage, ",
  "capacity building of the producers and processors and creation of an efficient supply chain ",
  "along with significant direct and indirect employment generation.",
  "The scheme aims to facilitate the establishment of a strong food processing industry ",
  "backed  by  an  efficient  supply  chain,  which  would  include  collection  centres,  primary ",
  "processing  centres  and  cold  chain  infrastructure.  The  food  processing  units,  under  the ",
  "scheme, would be located at a central processing centre (CPC) with requirements based ",
  "on  common  infrastructure  which  are  required  for  processing, packaging,  environmental ",
  "protection systems, quality control labs, trade facilitation centres, etc.",
  "Urgency of Such Initiatives\u2014Reasons",
  "As mentioned earlier, it is because of the growing market largely because of increased ",
  "income  of  people,  rapid  urbanization,  changing  demographics,  movement  away  from ",
  "joint families to nuclear families and increasing number of working women. The changing ",
  "pace of life has marked a preference for processed food.",
  "These  have  resulted  in  shift  in  consumption  driven  by  the  processed  food  market, ",
  "which is increasing and presently accounts for 32 per cent of the total food market and is ",
  "likely to grow further only. The food processing industry is growing and has become one ",
  "of the largest industries in India\u2014it is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, ",
  "export and expected growth.",
  "Consumption patterns in India have been undergoing a visible shift. Earlier, the share ",
  "of cereal products was the highest, followed by milk and milk products, vegetables, edible ",
  "oil and meat products. However, in recent years, the growth rates for fruits, vegetables, ",
  "meat and dairy products have been higher than cereals and pulses. This shift in turn implies ",
  "that there is also a need to diversify the food production base to match the changing ",
  "consumption preferences.",
  "This shift in consumption follows the pattern observed in developed countries in the ",
  "evolution of the global food demand. There is a shift from carbohydrate staples to animal ",
  "sources and sugar. On following this pattern, in future, there will be increasing demand ",
  "for prepared meals, snack foods and convenience foods and further on the demand would ",
  "shift towards functional, organic and diet foods. These are post-liberalization trends that ",
  "have given an impetus to the sector.",
  "Some Structural Issues",
  "Farmers have a limited market for their agricultural produce, which are confined to the ",
  "local \u2018Mandis\u2019, and are governed by APMC under the respective state government; and the AGRICULTURE SECTOR 65",
  "farmers can only sell to them. They cannot sell directly to the private parties for further ",
  "processing. As a result, they are denied better prices and also prevent food processing. They ",
  "also have limited information about the market(s), prevailing prices and operate within ",
  "their limited knowledge, based on their own wisdom.",
  "The supply chain of agricultural produce from the farmer to the ultimate consumer ",
  "lacks  transparency  and  passes  through  a  number  of  middlemen  raising  cost  through ",
  "commission charges, resulting in higher prices without any value addition. Further, the ",
  "absence  of  storage/warehousing  facilities  and  an  inefficient  transport  system  results  in ",
  "wastage, which only add up to higher prices.",
  "There is virtual no use made of even the available technology let alone leveraging ",
  "technology in the entire supply chain. There is no quality control and testing mechanism ",
  "for  agricultural  produce  which  reaches  the  consumer.  The  extent  of  use  of  fertilizers, ",
  "hygiene aspects and whether they are safe for human consumption is not seen as anyone\u2019s ",
  "responsibility.",
  "Remedial Measures",
  "The government has taken the first step, by allowing the FDI in multi-brand retailing. ",
  "Despite the opposition by various vested groups, it is a step in the right direction (which ",
  "are dealt at length in the section on foreign investment). This will address most of the ",
  "structural issues, especially back end activities. This will lead to an organized development ",
  "of  the  supply  chain  bring  in  transparency  and  the  investment  in  development  of  cold ",
  "chains and warehousing facilities. It will also lead to a technology infusion and a boost ",
  "to the food processing industry. This will also ensure a larger participation of the private ",
  "sector in the entire chain.",
  "However, this step will require a critical enabler, that of, amending to the respective ",
  "APMC act of the respective state governments. This amendment will allow farmers to sell ",

  "yards for picking up produce from the farmers. It will also open up the supply chain.",
  "It is for this reason the central government has permitted the FDI subject to consent ",
  "of state governments.",
  "In recent times, there has been a biotechnology revolution and now is the time for \u2018food ",
  "revolution\u2019 around food processing industry and this is the reason why this industry is ",
  "known as a \u2018sunrise industry in view of its potentiality. India besides meeting its own food ",
  "needs in terms of quality, diversified and value added products is also capable of expanding ",
  "to global markets. The food market can never have a down turn like other markets as it ",
  "is driven as a basic necessity and the demand will always be there for the same. The real ",
  "challenge will be from the supply side or the ability to feed this growing market.",
  "The food processing industry in India has only become to evolve and has the capability ",
  "of becoming the fastest growing sector in the future, with tremendous opportunity and ",
  "potential, but also at the same time a challenge in overcoming the structural issues,66 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",

  "AGRICULTURE POLICY: VISION 2020",
  "Impressive strides attained by India in the agricultural front during the last three decades ",
  "could be attributed to the several million small farming families that form the backbone of ",
  "Indian agriculture and economy. Policy support, production strategies, public investment ",
  "in infrastructure, research and extension for crop, livestock and fisheries have significantly ",
  "helped to increase food production and its availability.",
  "Despite  the  impressive  growth  and  development,  India  is  still  home  to  the  largest ",
  "number of poor people of the world. India has high population pressure on land and other ",
  "resources to meet its food and development needs. Due to this, natural resource, water and ",
  "bio-diversity are under severe pressure.",
  "Due to the increase in population and income growth, demand for extra food grains ",
  "also increases. Besides this, significant increase in demand is happening in the supply of ",
  "livestock, fish and horticultural products as well.",
  "So, future increases in the production of cereals and non-cereal agricultural commodities ",
  "will have to be essentially achieved through increases in productivity, as the possibilities of ",
  "expansion of area and livestock population are minimal. To meet the projected demand in ",
  "the year 2020, country must double per hectare yield of various crops.",
  "Emerging Trends",
  "The agriculture sector recorded satisfactory growth recently due to improved technology, ",
  "irrigation,  inputs  and  pricing  policies.  Livestock,  poultry,  fisheries  and  horticulture  are ",
  "surging ahead in production growth in recent years. Industrial and service sectors have ",
  "expanded  faster  than  agriculture  sector  resulting  in  declining  share  of  agriculture  in ",
  "national accounts.",
  "Despite all these structural changes, agriculture still remains a key sector by providing ",
  "both employment and livelihood opportunities to more than 70 percent of the country\u2019s ",
  "population. The contribution of small farmers to the national and household food security ",
  "has been steadily increasing. The water availability for agricultural uses has reached a ",
  "critical level and deserves urgent policy attention.",
  "India is having high population pressure on land and other resources to meet its food ",
  "and developmental needs. The natural resource base of land, water and bio-diversity is ",
  "under severe and continuous pressure. Food demand challenges ahead are formidable and ",
  "there are serious gaps in yield potential and technology transfer. Due to this the national ",
  "average yields of most of the commodities are low.",
  "Concentration was on enhanced production of a few commodities like rice and wheat, ",
  "which could quickly contribute to increased total food and agricultural production. This ",
  "resulted in considerable depletion of natural resources and the rainfed dry areas having AGRICULTURE SECTOR 67",
