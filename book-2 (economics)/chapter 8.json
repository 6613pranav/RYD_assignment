  "NEW INDIA",
  "In  the  recent  past,  there  has  been  a  rapid  transformation  in  the  Indian  Economy  and ",
  "certain new features have emerged, old perceptions and outlook of the Indian Economy ",
  "has  changed  yielding  a  different  perspective  of  India  known  as  New  India  and  are ",
  "characterized by the following features:",
  "\u2022  India for a long period was believed to be a third world developing country and the ",
  "first feature is the change in the status from developing, third world country to that of ",
  "an emerging economy\u2019, which is an economy with a great potential for accelerating ",
  "growth  that  offers  investment  opportunities.  Its  huge  population  is  not  seen  as  a ",
  "liability, but is seen as source of demand and establishes India as the second largest ",
  "potential market in the world after China.",
  "\u2022  Various  international  reports  talk  of  the  future  decades  belonging  to  the  BRICS ",
  "economies comprising of Brazil, Russia, India China and South Africa. More recently, ",
  "Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam and Taiwan have also been provided the same status ",
  "and could witness a gradual shift in the global economy.",
  "\u2022  Secondly, change in the status from a third world economy to a potential economy\u2019 ",
  "and is significant as it questions the supremacy today of the first world countries. ",
  "It also implies larger say in global matters, sharing at global platforms and global ",
  "recognition of the New India.",
  "\u2022  India is widely believed to become a \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 as it already has millions of ",
  "knowledge hubs and with the government having set up the Knowledge Commission ",
  "of India for developing strategies for global knowledge to reside in the country.",
  "\u2022  India is being projected as a \u2018young economy\u2019 with over 50 per cent of its population ",
  "under 25 years of age or 70 per cent of the population under 35 years, a feature which ",
  "makes India unique  or the  only country  in the world .This  is in contrast to the global ",
  "     ",
  "phenomenon of ageing work force,increased longevity leading to largeproportion of",

  "\u2022  India is being now referred to as a \u2018market economy\u2019 where economic decisions of ",
  "production  and  pricing  are  largely  through  market  forces  of  demand  and  supply, ",
  "rather than the government.",
  "At  present,  pricing  of  food  grains  (minimum  support  price),  retail  petro  goods ",
  "such as LPG, kerosene and diesel (administered price mechanism), fertilizers (group ",
  "retention price scheme) and utilities are regulated by government and pricing of the ",
  "remaining products are market determined. Prices determined through the market are ",
  "said to be efficient\u2019.",
  "The aforementioned are some of the  emerging features of lndia known as the \u2018New India\u2019. Two ",
  "aspects need to be remembered in mind. First, the global perceptions having changed about ",
  "India gives a new perspective. Secondly, they reflect the \u2018advantages \u2019for India but still need ",

  "So it seems important to focus on the \u201cmother and child,\u201d involving maternal health ",
  "and early life interventions. With increased devolution of resources, states will need to ",
  "expand their capacity and improve the efficiency of service delivery by shifting their ",
  "focus  from  outlays  to  outcomes,  and  to  learn  by  monitoring,  innovating,  and  even ",
  "erring.",
  "Improving service delivery in the wake of the Fourteenth Finance Commission requires ",
  "an evolution in the relative roles of the Centre and the states:",
  "\u2666 Centre should focus on improving policies, strengthening regulatory institutions, ",
  "and facilitating cooperative and competitive federalism.",
  "\u2666  States  should  mobilize  around  implementing  programs  and  schemes  to  ensure ",
  "better service delivery.",
  "3.  The dynamic sectors such as services and manufacturing tend to grab public attention, ",
  "India cannot afford to neglect its agriculture. After all, nearly 42 per cent of Indian ",
  "households derive the bulk of their income from farming. Despite the many challenges, ",
  "there remains considerable room for optimism.",
  "States that perform well arc increasingly becoming \u201cmodels and magnets.\u201d They are ",
  "magnets because they attract resources, talent and technology away from the lagging ",
  "states, forcing change via the channel of \u201cexit\u201d, Optimism is reinforced by events of ",

  "EIGHT INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT INDIA",
  "Against  the  backdrop  of  robust  macro-economic  stability,  the  Indian  Economy  was ",
  "marked by two major domestic policy developments, the passage of the Constitutional ",
  "amendment, paving the way for implementing the transformational Goods and Services ",
  "Tax (GST), and the action to demonetise the two highest denomination notes.",
  "The GST will create a common Indian market, improve tax compliance and governance, ",
  "and boost investment and growth; it is also a bold new experiment in the governance of ",
  "India\u2019s  cooperative  federalism.  Demonetisation  has  had  short-term  costs  but  holds  the ",
  "potential for longterm benefits. Follow-up actions to minimize the costs and maximise ",
  "the benefits include: fast, demand-driven, remonetisation; further tax reforms, including ",
  "bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing tax rates and stamp duties; and acting ",
  "to allay anxieties about over-zealous tax administration.",
  "Looking further ahead, societal shifts in ideas and narratives will be needed to overcome ",
  "three  long-standing  meta-challengcs:  inefficient  redistribution,  ambivalence  about  the ",
  "private sector and property rights, and improving but still-challenged state capacity.  In ",

  "In this challenging scenario, when India is poising to gain the momentum with GST, ",
  "Demonetisation, and other financial reforms after the long year of policy paralysis, India, ",
  "however, dealing with some interesting facts regarding its Economy. Here are the eight ",
  "interesting facts about India that reflect on an economy in transition.",
  "1. Indians on the Move",
  "New  estimates  based  on  railway  passenger  traffic  data  reveal  annual  work-related ",
  "migration of about 9 million people, almost double what the 2011 Census suggests.",
  "2. Biases in Perception",
  "China\u2019s credit rating was upgraded from A+ to AA- in December 2010 while India\u2019s has ",
  "remained unchanged at BBB-. From 2009 to 2015, China\u2019s credit-to-GDP soared from ",
  "about 142 percent to 205 percent and its growth decelerated.",
  "In the same period, India\u2019s Credit-to-GDP soared from about 70 percent to 75 percent ",
  "and its growth is well above China. This contrast with India\u2019s indicators is striking.",
  "3. New Evidence on Weak Targeting of Social Programs",
  "Welfare spending in India suffers from misallocation: the districts with the most poor ",
  "are the ones that suffer from the greatest shortfall of funds in social programs. The ",
  "districts accounting for the poorest 40% receive 29% of the total funding.",
  "4.  Political Democracy but Fiscal Democracy",
  "India has 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters ranking us 13th amongst 18 of our democratic ",
  "G-20 peers.",

  "5 India's Distinctive Demographic Dividend",
  "India\u2019s share of working age to non-working age population will peak later and at a ",
  "lower level than that for other countries but last longer. The peak of the growth boost ",
  "due to the demographic dividend is fast approaching, with peninsular states peaking ",
  "soon and the hinterland states peaking much later.",
  "Demographic Dividend in Indian States and Other Emerging Economies",

  "6 . India  Trades  More  than China  and   aLo tWithin Itself",
  ".As of 2011, India\u2019s openness - measured as the ratio of trade in goods and services to ",
  "GDP has far overtaken China\u2019s, a country famed for using trade as an engine of growth. ",
  "India\u2019s internal trade to GDP is also comparable to that of other large countries and ",
  "very different from the caricature of a barrier-riddled economy.",
  "7. Divergence within India, Big Time",
  "Spatial dispersion in income is still rising in India in the last decade (2004-14), unlike ",
  "the rest of the world and even China. That is, despite more porous borders within India ",
  "than between countries internationally, the forces of \u201cconvergence\u201d have been elusive.",
  "8 .Property Tax Potentia lUnexploited",
  "Evidence from satellite data indicates that Bengaluru and Jaipur collect only between ",
  "5% to 20% of their potential property taxes.",
