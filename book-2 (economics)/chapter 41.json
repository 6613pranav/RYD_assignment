  "INDIAN ECONOMY\u00ad",
  "OUTLOOK AND ",
  "CHALLENGES",
  "This  is  the  concluding  section,  addressing  the  outlook  for  the  Indian  Economy  after ",
  "discussing at all the facets and perspectives of the domestic economy, the world economy ",
  "and the economic reforms. The outlook would also have its own set of challenges which ",
  "would have to be overcome.",
  "GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE\u2014INDIA AND CHINA",
  "First, the outlook from a global perspective, India clearly is one of the fastest growing ",
  "emerging economies of the world, next to China, having the potential to overtake China ",
  "in the medium-term. Though in recent times there has been a sharp deceleration in growth ",
  "of India but these are for domestic reasons rather than global compulsions. Some of the ",
  "distinct advantages which India has over China are:",
  "(1)  India is the largest democracy in the world, elected government, participative and ",
  "collective wisdom within the government moving up the economic ladder slowly but ",
  "consensus-driven and with long-term sustainability.",
  "(2)  India with its young population would contribute to the global workforce.",
  "(3)  It has the largest number of English-speaking workforce outside the US.",
  "(4)  Annually,  India  produces  6  lakh  engineers,  some  world-class  from  the  IIT  and ",
  "some mediocre. Even if 25 per cent of them are world-class it would mean one lakh ",
  "engineers a year which is impressive by any global standards.",
  "(5)  India is a way ahead of China in respect of market-determined exchange rate, fairly ",
  "open capital account besides already having current account convertibility.",
  "(6)  India\u2019s  financial  sector  is  fairly  liberalized,  transparent  accounting  practices, ",
  "standardized  income  recognition,  asset  classification  norms,  with  high  levels  of ",
  "capital than that prescribed by the international standards.",
  "(a) Indian banks were the first, amongst emerging economies to have already ",
  "implemented the Basel II accord.",
  "(7)  There is a freedom of speech, freedom to express opinions on important issues besides ",
  "relatively a free media. This provides for internal checks and balances and also testing ",
  "of policies and consensus building on sensitive economic issues.352 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(8)  In  recent  times,  China  with  its  high  growth  earlier has started showing signs  of ",
  "an  overheated  economy  with  infrastructural  constraints  surfacing,  increase  in ",
  "unemployment and the pinch of inflationary pressures.",
  "India on the other hand, is better placed in these areas as inflationary pressures ",
  "have already peaked and have begun their down-turn.",
  "However, these latent advantages have to be leveraged by India to reap the benefits of ",
  "double digit fastest growing economy.",
  "41.2 DOMESTIC OUTLOOK",
  "(1)  The government will have to relook at the unfinished agenda of economic reforms ",
  "and pursue with the  right vigour as that displayed during 1991.",
  "(2)  It will have to reshape itself becoming more professional in its approach from a ",
  "\u2018driver\u2019 of growth to \u2018management\u2019 of growth, which is allowing growth itself to grow ",
  "with its own momentum, by playing the role of a facilitator.",
  "(3)  This would require the government to create an enabling environment, within which ",
  "the growth not only increases but is allowed to spread more evenly across the economy.",
  "(4)  It  has  to  embrace  electronic  governance,  provide  for  technology  and  innovation ",
  "intensive  investment,  aimed  at  newer  technologies,  at  affordable  prices,  benefiting ",
  "the masses.",
  "(5)  It has to look at newer ways of\u20183 Es\u2019 Envisioning, Empowerment and their smooth ",
  "and seamless Execution.",
  "(6)  It cannot lose sight of the problems of poverty and malnourishment of a vast section ",
  "of population.",
  "(7)  It also has to ensure that growth rates in future should be more broad-based in nature ",
  "and benefit masses.",
  "(8)  Skill formation has to be given priorities by strengthening the institutional framework ",
  "and that sufficient skills are available to meet the growing output of the economy.",
  "(9)  It will require a better understanding of its role changing to creating an enabling ",
  "environment for all the sectors to deliver.",
  "Finally, from a financial perspective, the role of RBI and its responsibilities would have to ",
  "radically change as India enters a globalized world.",
  "41.3 OUTLOOK FOR RESERVE BANK OF INDIA (RBI)",
  "The RBI would have to play the role of ensuring seamless transition of the Indian banks to ",
  "the internationally prescribed Basel III norms. It would have to build better risk assessment ",
  "capabilities, riska ppetitea ndsu fficiencyof cap ital,inth e I ndia nbanki ngsystem ,inthew ak eof ",
  "the gl oba l fi nancial  fallout . The gov ernm ent has set up a n ap ex lev el fin ancial  stability ",
  "developm  ent council (FSDC) foraddre ssin g issues of financi al  stability , inter-regu latory ",
  "coordinatio n,financiallit eracyand financia linc lusion.  ",
  "Though this council is still at a nascent stage but RBI would be required to play a ",
  "major role with other regulators providing inputs. Its role should not be that of excessive INDIAN ECONOMY\u2014OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES 353",
  "regulations  but  to  provide  a  domestic  oversight  mechanism  to  financial  and  other ",
  "sectors and a conduit to pass on global financial developments. RBI would also need to ",
  "understand that while credit contraction or expansion by banks lies within its purview, it is ",
  "not answerable for any deceleration in industrial growth, arising out of credit contraction.",
  "This is what the council should do to provide the interface and not earn the status of a ",
  "\u2018super regulator\" in the economy. It should only be a platform for providing interface with ",
  "other regulators of the economy. Neither should the council allow emergence of a super ",
  "regulator in the economy. As a super regulatory would only make the other regulators in ",
  "the economy meaningless and ineffective, defeating the very purpose of a regulator.",
  "It should also have to take critical decisions especially in respect of exchange rates in ",
  "determining the levels and timing of its intervention to manage exchange rates. Another ",
  "aspect would be managing the capital inflows. We had previously discussed about the ",
  "\u2018impossible trinity\u2019 of being able to manage any two, between exchange rate, open capital ",
  "account and an independentm onetary policy.Th iswo uld bethe  bigg estchall engeforthe  RB Iin  ",
  "futur e.",
  "Overall, the Indian Economy has a bright outlook, from all the angles, but still requires ",
  "first, conversion of advantages as opportunities and then their encashment. It places great ",
  "responsibilities on the shoulders of the government and RBI of leading from the front, and ",
  "make India a front runner amongst the emerging economies in the future.",
  "INDIAN OUTLOOK\u2014CHALLENGES AHEAD",
  "While  India  is  a  global  prospect,  full  of  opportunities,  a  potentially  fastest  growing ",
  "economy  and  larger  global  presence  it  has  some  inherent  stiff  challenges.  The  first ",
  "challenge, as outlined previously of the ability of converting advantages into opportunities ",
  "and subsequent encashment or translation into increased investment, output and income. ",
  "The second being, the global outlook still has many question marks and uncertainties of ",
  "the following:",
  "(1) Recovery of large economies post-crisis.",
  "(2)Fears of double-dip recession.",
  "(3)Uncertain future of Euro and Eurozone.",
  "(4)Smaller economic ability to destabilize global economy.",
  "(5)Implications of growing sovereign debt of large economies, Implications of a different ",
  "international reserve currency other than USD.",
  "These uncertainties impose greater challenge for countries such as India and China ",
  "for lifting global output.",
  "The changing global axis towards the emerging economies is seen as a welcome feature of ",
  "the new world order. There are two aspects to understand in this shift, one of the axis being ",
  "\u2018pulled\" towards the emerging economies, and the other, of the axis being pushed\" towards ",
  "the emerging economies. Which is happening \u2018pulled or pushed?\"",
  "The global crisis is pushing the axis towards emerging economics as the only way going ",
  "forward. It is not that something dramatic has happened in these emerging economies, ",
  "especially India. As we have seen previously, the unfinished agenda before the government 354 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "the  pause  on economic reforms  only  re-affirm the aspect of being pushed rather than ",
  "being pulled.",
  "Thus, the larger question of countries such as India is it \u2018prepared\u2019 for such structural shift ",
  "of the global economy? Capital inflows into these economies was seen as good for them, but ",
  "large surge inflows recently, has been seen as potentially destabilizing, and has triggered cur\u00ad",
  "rency war situations. Most economies have resultantly imposed restrictions of such inflows. ",
  "India has restrained so far but for how long?",
  "These inflows are coming because of quantitative easing by the US and not due to ",
  "any particular positive feature of the emerging economies like India. \u2018It is absence of an ",
  "alternate window which is causing this surge in inflows.\u2019 However, such can also seep into ",
  "real estate, commodities, besides the stock market and also corporate and sovereign debt ",
  "market creating \u2018asset bubbles\u2019, which by definition, will burst when the economy is least ",
  "prepared.",
  "An equally greater challenge for countries like India would be how to manage outflows, ",
  "asset bubbles bursting, if they happen, once an alternate window is available? Another ",
  "belief of the new world order is the likelihood of increased penetration of countries, for ",
  "example, India in the global economy with larger share of exports of goods and services.",
  "Given  the  market  imperfections  in  India, can it  be globally  competitive  to achieve ",
  "penetration?  India\u2019s  export  sector  continues  to  lack  maturity  of  understanding  the ",
  "importance of moving up the value chain, rather than, exchange rate movements, as more ",
  "fundamental, to achieve the levels of penetration. The integrated global economy would ",
  "definitely open opportunities, but penetration, will largely rest on ability of countries like ",
  "India to emerge as globally competitive.",
  "Yet  another  aspect  is  that  India  and  China  by  virtue  of  their  large  population  are ",
  "being seen as potential markets but do these markets have income or purchasing power ",
  "to actually become market as widely believed? That is, besides the above challenges; it will ",
  "also have a larger set of domestic challenges. They are as follows:",
  "(1)  The major challenge of an impoverished India, home to largest number of people ",
  "living below USD 1 per day, of absolute poverty, malnourished and a large social ",
  "sector outside the mainstream of development.",
  "(a) The challenge will be of drawing the vast lot of such people, larger than ",
  "population of many countries, into mainstream of development.",
  "(2)  A larger challenge as expressed by the eleventh five-year plan and would also get ",
  "echoed in the twelfth five-year plan, of not increasing rates of growth, but of providing ",
  "greater inclusive growth.",
  "(a) The challenge is thus not growth but how to ensure they are evenly spread to ",
  "provide broad-based benefits to masses?",
  "(3)  Then the issue of a stagnant, traditional and livelihood agriculture. Is the agricultural ",
  "sector capable and prepared to meet the needs of a growing economy with rising ",
  "income levels?",
  "(4)  Despite all the talk about India as a new economy, India continues to be a country of ",
  "villages; the soul of India is in the 6 lakh villages.INDIAN ECONOMY\u2014OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES 355",
  "It is not about converting villages into towns. Villages are an essential fabric of the ",
  "Indian economy, but how to make them self-contained in terms of basic amenities ",
  "and also provide people in the villages, with a source of income?",
  "We have seen earlier, the huge investment deficit especially in infrastructure sector ",
  "like power. From where does one raise the huge resources required for bridging this ",
  "deficit?",
  "This is not to talk about rural infrastructure, which is already crumbling, requiring ",
  "not only re-building but also fresh investment.",
  "(5)  Even die industrial and financial sectors where reforms have been centred, there is ",
  "still a large presence of the public sector.",
  "Will they be competitive and continue to be profitable, as a public sector, in the ",
  "absence of their privatization, in a rapidly transforming market economy of India?",
  "(6)  India\u2019s growing dependence on imported crude petroleum will only increase with ",
  "increased growth.",
  "However,  how  does  India  insulate  itself  from  sharp  volatility  in  international ",
  "crude petroleum prices?",
  "How does one build energy security in India? Are we concerned of our structural ",
  "problems in the energy sector?",
  "(7)  In the recent past the government has been accused of a \u2018policy paralysis\u2019 but in ",
  "reality it is more of \u2018policy uncertainties\u2019, absence of \u2018policy continuity\u2019 and fears ",
  "of policy reversal\u2019. These are far more critical, influencing the entire economy than ",
  "policy paralysis. The biggest difference is that policy paralysis can be shrugged off, ",
  "while others require restoration of faith and that is the challenge of restoration of ",
  "faith in the government.",
  "An attempt has been made here to highlight the challenges as India prepares to go into ",
  "the future. These challenges are not insurmountable, but need to be overcome. However, ",
  "it will require sustained efforts, desire to overcome, collective political will and above ",
  "all a realization, on the part of the government, of their criticality and fundamental in ",
  "reshaping the Indian economy.",
  "To reiterate, India has the advantage over other economies but the ability to harness ",
  "them as opportunities and taping them, whether global or internal, is in the hands of India ",
  "only. The fate of the Indian Economy in future is within our own hands, collectively and ",
  "to shake up the government to make India realize its full potential, if not beyond usher in ",
  "a new India, and restoring India to its past glory and stature, presently confined as leaves ",
  "of history.",
  "41.5 INDIA 2020: TOP 7 CHALLENGES.",
  "Though  India  may  already  be  the  worlds  third-largest  economy  on  purchasing  power ",
  "parity, it ranks only 58th out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forums Global ",
  "Competitiveness Index of 2018. With high inflation, slow growth and lowering investor ",
  "confidence, India faces seven key challenges while looking at 2020 and beyond.356 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "1.  Education  and  skills.  Though  India  is  housing  more  than  400  million  workers, ",
  "more than two-thirds of Indian employers report that they are unable to find workers ",
  "with the right skills to meet their workforce demand. This contrast indicates to clear ",
  "opportunities ahead, while posing serious challenges with regard to education and ",
  "skill development. The World Bank launched its first Human Capital Index (HCI) ",
  "in Bali, Indonesia on October 11, 2018, as part of the World Development Report ",
  "2019. The index ranks countries based on their success in developing human capital. ",
  "India ranks 115 in World Bank human capital index.That\u2019s much below its Asian ",
  "peers,  including  China  ranked  46,  Indonesia  (87),  Malaysia  (55).  Singapore  was ",
  "ranked number one in the world followed by Japan, Hong Kong and Finland.",
  "2.  Urbanization. More than one-third of Indians live in cities. It is estimated that, by",
  "2050, as many as 900 million people will be living in urban areas, Meeting their  ",
  "needs while safeguarding the environment will require innovative ands ustained",
  "models of urban development in the years ahead.",
  "3. Health. On health front, India faces the double burden of infectious diseasesand  ",
  "dramatic rise in non-communicable diseases. Apart from causing individual tragedies, ",
  "these diseases are also posing major economic threats.",
  "4. Sanitation.  Many  health  challenges  are  linked  to  sanitation.  Linking  a  clean ",
  "environment to human capital productivity is an issue that should be looked at as an ",
  "investment and not a cost. The challenge is to identify and implement the right way ",
  "to every Indians a clean environment.",
  "5. Gender. The gender gap prevents economic development all around the world. ",
  "There is an urgent need for India to actively address the issue of violence and gender ",
  "discrimination. This is another challenge before India while trying to reap the full ",
  "potentials.",
  "6.  Water scarcity. Growing population places a severe strain on its natural resources. ",
  "Since the most of the water sources are contaminated by sewage, industrial wastage ",
  "and agricultural run-off, ensuring adequate water supply will remain a challenge.",
  "7.  Transparency.  Transparency  issue  dampens  the  whole  economy.  It  hampers ",
  "competitiveness,  growth  and  overall  development  of  the  country.  India  has  to ",
  "urgently address this challenge as well.",
  "Diverse challenges of this complexity and magnitude cannot be expected to be solved ",
  "by  government  interventions  alone.  There  is  a  requirement  for  collaborative  approach ",
  "with active involvement from various stake holders.THE IGNITERS:",
