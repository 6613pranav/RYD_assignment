  "BANKING",
  "In the previous chapter, it was mentioned that the apex bank is the RBI besides acting ",
  "as a banker to the government. It is also banker to banks and functions as the monetary ",
  "authority in the economy.",
  "15.1 BANKS IN INDIA",
  "Bank is a financial intermediary between the people (which accept deposits from them ",
  "by providing them interest on deposits maintained within the bank) and economy (lends ",
  "for productive purposes at an interest) and in the process earns profits. This is known ",
  "as commercial banking. Banking in India is truly a reflection of a mixed economy with ",
  "public sector banks, private and foreign banks.",
  "Public  sector  banks  in  India  are  presently  twenty-one  comprising  of  State  Bank  of ",
  "India. Banks have an important role to act in the overall growth of an economy in their ",
  "ability to lend to various sectors of the economy for expansion, diversification of existing ",
  "businesses and also to support the new businesses.",
  "In  line  with  the  liberalization  policy,  reforms  were  also  initiated  simultaneously  in ",
  "the  banking  sector  during  1991  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Narasimham ",
  "committee.",
  "Before 1991, banking was highly sheltered and regulated by the RBI, like the industrial ",
  "sector. To support the policy of liberalization and also to allow for growth of the private ",
  "sector, it became essential to undertake banking sector reforms.",
  "BANKING STRUCTURE IN INDIA",
  "Reserve Bank of India (RBI)",
  "The RBI is the supreme monetary and banking authority in the country\u2019 and controls ",
  "the banking system in India. It is called the Reserve Bank\u2019 as it keeps the reserves of all ",
  "commercial banks.",
  "The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  was  established  on  April  1, 1935  in accordance with the ",
  "provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.168 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "The Central Office of the  Reserve  Bank was initially  established  in Calcutta  but was ",
  "permanently  moved to Mumbai in 1937.T heC entral O ffice is wh ere the Go vernor sits and  ",
  "wherepoli ciesaref orm ulated.",
  "Though originally privately owned, since nationalisation in 1949, the Reserve Bank is ",
  "fully owned by the Government of India.",
  "Scheduled & Non-scheduled Banks",
  "A scheduled bank is a bank that is listed under the second schedule of the RBI Act, ",
  "1934. In order to be included under this schedule of the RBI Act, banks have to fulfill ",
  "certain conditions such as having a paid up capital and reserves of at least 0.5 million and ",
  "satisfying the Reserve Bank that its affairs are not being conducted in a manner prejudicial ",
  "to the interests of its depositors. Scheduled banks are further classified into commercial ",
  "and cooperative banks. Non- scheduled banks are those which are not included in the ",
  "second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934.",
  "Commercial Banks",
  "Commercial banks may be defined as, any banking organization that deals with the deposits ",
  "and loans of business organizations. Commercial banks issue bank checks and drafts, as ",
  "well as accept money on term deposits. Commercial banks also act as moneylenders, by ",
  "way of installment loans and overdrafts. Commercial banks also allow for a variety of ",
  "deposit accounts, such as checking, savings, and time deposit. These institutions are run ",
  "to make a profit and owned by a group of individuals.",
  "Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)",
  "Scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) account for a major proportion of the business of ",
  "the scheduled banks. SCBs in India are categorized into the five groups based on their ",
  "ownership and/or their nature of operations. State Bank of India and its six associates ",
  "(excluding State Bank of Saurashtra, which has been merged with the SBI with effect ",
  "from August 13, 2008) are recognised as a separate category of SCBs, because of the ",
  "distinct statutes (SBI Act, 1955 and SBI Subsidiary Banks Act, 1959) that govern them. ",
  "Nationalised banks and SBI and associates together form the public sector banks group ",
  "IDBI ltd. has been included in the nationalised banks group since December 2004. Private ",
  "sector banks include the old private sector banks and the new generation private sector ",
  "banks- which were incorporated according to the revised guidelines issued by the RBI ",
  "regarding the entry of private sector banks in 1993.",
  "Foreign  banks  are  present  in  the  country  either  through  complete  branch/subsidiary ",
  "route presence or through their representative offices.BANKING 169",
  "Types of Scheduled Commercial Banks",
  "Public Sector Banks",
  "These are banks where majority stake is held by the Government of India. Examples of ",
  "public sector banks are: SBI, Bank of India, Canara Bank, etc.",
  "Private Sector Banks",
  "These are banks majority of share capital of the bank is held by private individuals. These ",
  "banks are registered as companies with limited liability. Examples of private sector banks ",
  "are: ICICI Bank, Axis bank, HDFC, etc.",
  "Foreign Banks",
  "These banks are registered and have their headquarters in a foreign country but operate ",
  "their branches in our country. Examples of foreign banks in India are: HSBC, Citibank, ",
  "Standard Chartered Bank, etc",
  "Regional Rural Banks",
  "Regional Rural Banks were established under the provisions of an Ordinance promulgated ",
  "on the 26th September 1975 and the RRB Act, 1976 with an objective to ensure sufficient ",
  "institutional credit for agriculture and other rural sectors. The area of operation of RRBs is ",
  "limited to the area as notified by Gol covering one or more districts in the State.",
  "RRBs are jointly owned by Gol, the concerned State Government and Sponsor Banks ",
  "(27 scheduled commercial banks and one State Cooperative Bank); the issued capital of a ",
  "RRB is shared by the owners in the proportion of 50%, 15% and 35% respectively.170 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Cooperative Banks",
  ">co-operative bank is a financial entity which belongs to its members, who are at the ",
  "same time  the  owners  and  the  customers  of  their  bank.  Co-operative  banks  are  often ",
  "created by persons belonging to the same local or professional community or sharing a ",
  "common interest. Co-operative banks generally provide their members with a wide range ",
  "of banking and financial services (loans, deposits, banking accounts, etc).",
  "\u2022  'Ihey  provide  limited  banking  products  and  are  specialists  in  agriculture-relatec ",
  "products.",
  "\u2022  Cooperative banks are the primary financiers of agricultural activities, some small- ",
  "scale industries and self-employed workers.",
  "\u2022  Co-operative banks function on the basis of \u201cno-profit no-loss\u201d.",
  "\u2022  Anyonya Co-operative Bank Limited (ACBL)  is t he f irst c o-operative b ank in India  ",
  "located in the city of Vadodara in Gujarat.",
  "15.3 MAJOR AREAS OF REFORM IN THE BANKING SECTOR",
  "(1)  Liberal entry of private sector and foreign banks. It is as a part of the reforms that ",
  "today there are big private banks such as ICICI, HDFC, Axis and foreign banks such ",
  "as the Citi group, HSBC, Barclays operating along with the public sector banks.",
  "(2)  Public  sector  were  provided  greater  autonomy  to  function  in  a  competitive ",
  "environment and frame independent policies based on broad framework provided by ",
  "RBI.",
  "(3)  Interest rates both the deposits as well as advances were de-regulated and each bank ",
  "was free to decide on the interest rates it chose to offer including interest on savings ",
  "account which until recently was regulated by RBI.",
  "(4)  Similarly, in respect of lending rates, banks were free to decide on the interest rate they ",
  "would charge, they had to publish the lowest rate of interest they would charge to ",
  "their best except that clients known as the benchmarked prime lending rate (BPLR).",
  "\u2022  BPLR, however, lacked transparency as banks were lending even below BPLR ",
  "known as sub BPLR lending. As a result, transmission of policy rate of RBI on ",
  "lending by banks was diffused. To obviate this, RBI in 2010 has asked the banks ",
  "to switch to base rate of interest, and that lending would not be done by banks, ",
  "below their respective published base rate of interest, except DRI advances for ",
  "weaker sector, loans against own deposits and loans to employees.",
  "\u2022  The basic difference between BPLR and base rate is that, while BPLR had a ",
  "component of risk premium, it has to be loaded on the base rate. Thus, lending ",
  "below base rate would be a losing proposition for banks.",
  "\u2022  The MCLR methodology for fixing interest rates for advances was introduced by ",
  "the Reserve Bank of India with effect from April 1, 2016. This new methodology ",
  "replaces the base rate system introduced in July 2010. In other words, all rupee ",
  "Ioans sanctioned and credit limits renewed w.e.f. April 1, 2016 would be priced ",
  "with reference to the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) which ",
  "will be the internal benchmark (means a reference rate determined internally by ",
  "the bank) for such purposes.BANKING 171",
  "\u2022  Existing loans and credit limits linked to the Base Rate (internal benchmark rate ",
  "used  to  determine  interest  rates  uptill  31  March  2016)  or  Benchmark  Prime ",
  "Lending  Rate  (BPLR  or  the  internal  benchmark  rate  used  to  determine  the ",
  "interest rates on advances/loans sanctioned upto June 30, 2010.) would continue ",
  "till repayment or renewal, as the case may be. However, existing borrowers will ",
  "have the  option  to move  to the  Marginal  Cost  of Funds based  Lending Rate ",
  "(MCLR) linked loan at mutually acceptable terms.",
  "\u2022  The marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) refers to the minimum ",
  "interest rate of a bank below which it cannot lend, except in some cases allowed ",
  "by the RBI. It is an internal benchmark or reference rate for the bank. MCLR ",
  "actually  describes  the  method  by  which  the  minimum  interest  rate  for  loans ",
  "is determined by a bank - on the basis of marginal cost or the additional or ",
  "incremental cost of arranging one more rupee to the prospective borrower.",
  "(5)  Banking was made more transparent, stress on full disclosure of both the good and ",
  "bad assets.",
  "(6)  There was a standardization and uniform income recognition, asset classification and ",
  "provisioning norms for the banking sector. For the first time, a uniform definition ",
  "was  given  to  non-performing  assets  (NPAs)  known  as  the  90  days  norms.  Thus, ",
  "interest on loans provided if not received within the stipulated time would require to ",
  "be classified as an NPA.",
  "(7)  Realizing that banking is risky business having normal risks in lending and also to ",
  "safeguard interest, banks were required to adhere to \u2018capital adequacy\u2019 norms in terms ",
  "of international best practices (dealt separately below).",
  "Finally, the overall objective was to bring in greater competition in the banking sector ",
  "allowing for better products, improved services and fine-tuned interest rates to support the ",
  "financial requirements of a growing economy like India and enable bigger banks in India ",
  "to emerge as global banks.",
  "CAPITAL ADEQUACY (BASEL NORMS)",
  "Capital adequacy is a part of the larger global frame work of banking committee for ",
  "financial supervision (BCFC), also known as Basel I and II and now also III norms post- ",
  "global crisis. (Basel is a place in Switzerland where BCFC prescribed norms applicable to ",
  "all banks across countries and thus known as Basel norms). Capital adequacy implies that ",
  "any bank, being engaged in a business of lending has normal risks\u2019 associated and should ",
  "have some minimum own funds to meet such risks.",
  "Capital  of  banks  being  defined  as  the  banks  own  capital  and  reserves  as  the  core ",
  "capital (Tier I) and also a component of supplementary capital (Tier II) is available to ",
  "banks but less readily, like the revaluation of its assets (taken at a discount), provisions ",
  "held  for  standard  assets  and  long-term  bonds  raised  by  the  bank  (sub-ordinated ",
  "debt).",
  "Banks are today required to have their own capital in terms of shareholders funds, ",
  "retained profits (deposits in banks are not bank\u2019s own but public money). The condition 172 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "was that Tier II capital could not be more than 100 per cent of Tier I capital and that ",
  "subordinated debt under Tier II capital not to exceed 50 per cent of Tier I capital.",
  "The assets portfolio of a bank were weighted by the risk element, prescribed by central ",
  "banks in the respective countries and aggregated, and a minimum 8 per cent of capital ",
  "prescribed as the capital adequacy measure or Basel I norms. Which is, if a bank has risk ",
  "weighted assets of \u20b91 00 then itsh ould behav ing atleas tasca pit al (Tier Iand  II ),to comp ly ",
  "with theBaselIn orms.   ",
  "Reserve Bank of India for Indian Banks, as a part of the financial sector reforms gave a ",
  "time frame to Indian banks to become the Basel compliant. Subsequently, the norm was ",
  "raised to 9 per cent and continues to be the same presently in India. Basel II norms further ",
  "refined the concept of measurement of risk and also brought in concept of operational ",
  "risk,  which  are  not  covered  as  part  of  the  Basel  I  norms  and  retaining  the  ratio  as ",
  "8 per cent. All Indian banks are both Basel I and II compliant.",
  "Post-global crisis the ratio has been further increased implying greater capacity need ",
  "for banks to ensure that such global financial sector crisis does not recur in future. Capital ",
  "adequacy thus has allowed for financial regulations to become global. It also allows any ",
  "investor or a depositor to know the fundamental strength of banks and take their own ",
  "informed decisions based on the capital adequacy levels of different banks.",
  "LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT BY RBI",
  "Relevance  of  banking  apart  from  meeting  the  growing  needs  of  the  economy  is  their ",
  "strong linkage with inflation through their ability to increase liquidity in the economy. ",
  "This is said to be as one of the major cause for buildup of inflationary pressures.",
  "Liquidity",
  "A bank accepts deposits from the public which is lent in the economy. The money which ",
  "can potentially\u2019 be lent by the banks is known to be liquidity. Bank leverages the deposit ",
  "manifold for lending in the economy known as \u2018credit creation\u2019 by banks. This credit ",
  "creation is almost like fresh money injected in the economy and contributes to inflationary ",
  "pressures. Thus, liquidity in the economy should strike a balance between requirements of ",
  "growth and at the same time keep the prices under check. Managing liquidity is a major ",
  "aspect of the RBI functions.",
  "Previously,  it  was  mentioned  that  RBI  was  the  apex  central  bank  of  the  country ",
  "functioning as banker to the government and banks, responsible for printing of currency\u2019 ",
  "notes, overseeing the functioning of the banking sector and now its another important and ",
  "critical role in liquidity management.",
  "It is important to understand first that money deposited in the bank is a source of ",
  "liquidity. Money deposited could either be \u2018demand\u2019 deposits (payable by the bank on ",
  "demand by a customer like money retaining in your savings account in the bank can be ",
  "withdrawn by you at any time) or, \u2018time\u2019 deposits (can be withdrawn after a fixed period ",
  "only like fixed deposits). Both demand as well as time deposits is the liabilities of the bank ",
  "as the bank has to pay it back to the customer.173",
  "BANKING",
  "Thus, both are known as \u2018demand and time liabilities\u2019 of banks. These demand and ",
  "time liabilities of the banking system are the source of increasing liquidity. If unchecked, ",
  "it will be keep on increasing. RBI cannot question the public to not deposit money in the ",
  "banks as it is the source of liquidity and neither can it direct banks to stop lending as if ",
  "they do not lend they will not be able to meet the interest on deposits which the banks ",
  "have to pay and also not able to earn profits for their future growth.",
  "RBI  thus  has  certain  quantitative  and  qualitative  tools  through  which  it  manages ",
  "liquidity and they are as follows:",
  "(1)  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)\u2014Every bank has to retain a certain percentage of its ",
  "demands and time liabilities in cash with the RBI which can be raised by the RBI to ",
  "drain out excess liquidity or reduced to release the liquidity in the economy.",
  "For example,o n ap ublicde positba seofo ve r\u20b9 50 ,0 0,000 croresin the bankin g system",
  "a1 per ce nt incr ease in CRR would le ad in overnight transfer  50,000 c rores from the ",
  "banki ng s ystemto RBIor which ca nn otbeleveraged  for lending by the banks.Even a0. ",

  "25 percentincreasewould imply about\u20b9 12,500 croresgoing outofthebanking system.",
  "             ",
  "Such alargeamountcould lead to adrop in lending by banksdampening industrialgrowth ",
  "       ",
  "oreven triggering arecession in theeconomy.",
  "                 ",
  "Thus, CRR as a monetary tool which has to be carefully used by the RBI keeping ",
  "                 ",
  "in view all aspects of the economy and not merely decreasing liquidity for fears of",
  "                     ",
  "inflation. Frequent use of the CRR, especially their increase by any central bank of a",
  "               ",
  "country sends negative sentiments in the economy. Changes in CRR are necessary in ",
  "             ",
  "exceptional circumstances or adverse developments in the economy rather than being ",
  "       ",
  "frequently used asamonetary toolformanaging liquidity.",
  "                           ",
  "The other issue in its use is that it is applicable to all banks alike and does",
  "                 ",
  "not allow banks to take a long-term lending decision as they are uncertain about",
  "                     ",
  "when  the RBI would  raise CRR. The present CRR effective from Dec, 2017  is",
  " ",
  "4.00 percent.",
  "               ",
  "(2) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)\u2014This is another monetary tool of the RBI, in ",
  "                 ",
  "terms of which every bank is required to set aside again a certain percentage of their",
  "               ",
  "demand and time liabilities and retain as cash with RBI, or in gold with the RBI or",
  "               ",
  "invested in government securities. The banks prefer to invest in government securities",
  "       ",
  "asitearnstheminterest.",
  "                     ",
  "At present, a minimum 20% (effective from August 2017) \u00bb r the demand and ",
  "                   ",
  "time liabilities are to  be invested. Banks have, however, parked  greater than  the",
  "             ",
  "minimum stipulation in government securities and is thus today an in-effective tool",
  "to managing liquidity.",
  "                       ",

  "                     ",
  "It presently uses as a penalty rate imposed by RBI on banks for violations of RBI",
  "directives.174 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(4)  Open market operations (OMO)\u2014This is sale/purchase of secondary government ",
  "securities by RBI through the auction route and not binding on the banks unlike ",
  "the CRR and SLR. In periods of excess liquidity RBI resorts to \u2018sale\u2019 of government ",
  "securities to banks draining out the money from banks thus reducing liquidity. For ",
  "increasing liquidity, it purchases\u2019 securities from banks thereby transferring money to ",
  "banks to lend resulting in liquidity increase. These OMO are performed at quarterly ",
  "intervals.",
  "(5)  Repo  auction  (Re-purchase  obligations)\u2014This  is  the most frequently used tool ",
  "by the RBI for managing short-term liquidity even overnight. It is the same as the ",
  "OMO except that there is an inbuilt clause of automatic \u2018repurchase\u2019 after a specified ",
  "period. Banks can keep eligible government securities, over and above those kept for ",
  "maintaining SLR, with RBI and borrow for a short period (generally overnight) and ",
  "interest paid by banks on such borrowings is called as \u2018Repo rate.\u2019",
  "RBI also has a window where it offers government securities, which banks can ",
  "subscribe, and the rate of interest now paid by the RBI to banks is referred as \u2018Reverse ",
  "repo.\u2019 Both of these will involve repurchase after the contracted period automatically. ",
  "Both these rates are determined by RBI. Repo rate and reverse repo rate are linked on ",
  "a 25 bps and always repo rate (presently 6.0% effective from September 2017) will be ",
  "higher than the reverse repo rate (presently 5.75% effective from September 2017).",
  "(6)  Marginal Standing Facility- This is a new Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) ",
  "created by Reserve Bank of India in 2011. It is a window for banks to borrow from ",
  "the Reserve Bank of India in an emergency situation when inter-bank liquidity dries ",
  "up completely. The MSF rate is pegged 100 basis points or a percentage point above ",
  "the Repo Rate. Under this facility, banks can borrow funds up to one percentage of ",
  "their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL)",
  "(7)  Moral Suasion. It refers to a method adopted by the Central Bank to persuade or ",
  "convince the commercial banks to advance credit in the economic interest of the ",
  "country. In this process, the Central Bank requests or persuade the commercial banks ",
  "to lend or credit to other banks or institutes in compliance with the general monetary ",
  "policy of the central.",
  "Ideally  short-term/volatile  liquidity  should  be  addressed  through  repo  auctions, ",
  "medium-term liquidity through OMO and long-term liquidity through the CRR.",
  "Reserve Bank of India addresses liquidity management and changes made to the ",
  "CRR, SLR, repo rates as part of the annual monetary policy reviewed on a quarterly ",
  "basis and rates revised keeping in view the liquidity position. An area of concern of ",
  "the RBI in its policy is to keep a watch on inflation. While RBI role, besides liquidity ",
  "management, controlling inflation, also acts as bankers to all  the  commercial  banks ",
  "in the country.",
  "15.6 DIRECTED LENDING OF RBI",
  "Reserve Bank of India as a part of mass banking, mandates that lending by banks should also ",
  "provide loans for agriculture, medium and small-scale sector industries and other critical ",

  "15.8 OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\u2014PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS",
  "There is a dominance of public sector banks even after two decades of financial sector ",
  "reforms, though getting eroded by the growing private banks. Their ability to undertake ",
  "large-scale lending for infrastructure, risk assessment and their mitigation capabilities are ",
  "yet to be tested.",
  "They are having issues of excessive manpower, ageing work force, \u2018adopted\u2019 technology ",

  "ness and not able to reach the needy segment like the small-scale sector, despite well-in\u00ad",
  "tentioned schemes both by the RBI as well as banks.",
  "As  mentioned  previously,  their  efforts  at  financial  inclusion  has  been  far  from ",
  "satisfactory and what is worrying is they still continue to look at it from a social and not as ",
  "a commercial proposition. Too many nationalized banks of different sizes not allowing for ",
  "their organized growth and one nationalized bank competing with the other.",
  "India can be said to have survived the global financial sector crisis of 2007, largely ",
  "perceived because of the public sector character, of not having the exposure to complex ",
  "products and seen as a prudent banking. But the same public sector character has largely ",
  "been responsible for not leading to expansion of banks in the same way as the private ",
  "banks are expanding.",

  "Clearly, directed lending is seen more as a compulsion as have to be performed, rather ",
  "than willingly lending to them. Seeing financial inclusion as a socio-welfare measure will ",
  "ensure that it will never happen. It has to be seen as a commercial and viable business. The ",
  "opportunity cost to the poor for raising money from money lenders is very high. They can ",
  "become an important profitable venture for banks. Any private bank will be driven by the ",
  "profitability angle, be it the rich or the poor segment.",
  "The biggest issue is the ability to reach out to them through an organized finance route, ",
  "besides the money lenders. The proliferation of MFIs in the private sector is an example of ",
  "how the profit motive can drive reaching them.",
  "However, this will require innovativeness as it may not be feasible nor practical or cost ",
  "effective to open bank branches in all the villages. Various models can be considered and ",

  "Financial inclusion is achieved when all individuals and businesses have access to and ",
  "can effectively use a broad range of financial services that are provided responsibly, and at ",
  "reasonable cost, by sustainable institutions in a well-regulated environment.",
  "The essence of financial inclusion is in trying to ensure that a range of appropriate ",
  "financial services is available to every individual and enabling them to understand and ",
  "access those services.",
  "In order to achieve a comprehensive financial inclusion, a slew of initiatives have been",
  "taken  by  Government  of  India,  RBI  and  NABARD.  Some  of  the  important initiatives ",

  "Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna etc.",
  "Financial  inclusion  can  happen,  but  with  technology  and  seeing  it  as  a  business ",
  "proposition rather than as a welfare measure. It is the biggest imperative today of linking ",
  "the poor to banks as it can serve multiple objectives of first, access to organized source of ",
  "finance for the poor, second getting them outside the clutches of the money lenders, third ",
  "allowing the government to provide them with income support rather than subsidies and ",

  "advisory committee headed by Nachiket Mor submitted its findings on 6th July 2015. The ",
  "applicant entities were examined for their financial track record and governance issues. ",
  "The objective of payment banks will bring unbanked masses under the ambit of formal ",

  "The key objectives of this scheme are stated as under:",

  "\u2022  To provide a fillip to the gems and jewellery sector in the country by making gold ",
  "available as raw material on loan from the banks.",
  "\u2022  To be able to reduce reliance on import of gold over time to meet the domestic demand. ",
  "The gold mobilization scheme is likely to work according to the draft guidelines:",
  "1. The scheme is meant to mobilize gold held by domestic households and institutions. ",
  "Gold collected through the scheme will be made available to jewellers for manufacturing ",
  "of new jewellery and other items.",
  "2. The scheme will initially be launched at a few places because the government will have ",
  "to first set-up infrastructure for facilitating easy and secure handling of gold. ",
  "3. Gold collected from consumers will first be cleaned and measured at test centres; it",
  "would then be melted to test for purity. After the tests, consumers can either deposit ",
  "the gold for a fee or take it back after paying a nominal fee.",
  "4.  The minimum quantity of gold that a customer can bring is proposed to be set at 30 ",
  "grams.",
  "5.  Those willing to deposit the gold will be given a certificate mentioning the amount ",
  "and purity of the deposited gold. Banks will open a \u2018Gold Savings Account\u2019 on the ",

  "bringing into circulation domestically-held idle gold, thus, helping the external balances. ",
  "Additionally, the easy availability of the precious metal can reduce costs for jewellers and ",
  "increase the exports. Seeking to mobilise idle gold worth up to Rs 60 lakh crore held by ",
  "households  and  institutions,  the  government  proposed  a  new  scheme  offering  tax-free ",
  "interest on depositing the yellow metal with banks. The draft of gold monetisation scheme ",
  "also provides for incentives to the banks. Individuals and institutions can deposit as low as ",
  "30 gms of gold, while the interest earned on it would be exempt from income tax as well ",
  "as capital gains tax.",
  "The government can partly address the problem to a certain extent by making invoices ",
  "mandatory only for gold brought in the form of bars or coins and not necessarily for ",
  "household  ornaments.  The  banks  can  track  the  transaction  with  sufficient  proofs  on ",
