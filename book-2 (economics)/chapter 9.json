  "INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND",
  "LIBERALIZATION",
  "ROLE OF INDUSTRY IN AN ECONOMY",
  "Previously, we have addressed the agricultural sector and its importance to the economy. ",
  "The industrial sector plays an equally important role as it accelerates growth of economies, ",
  "provides  self-reliance,  employment,  creates  a  demand  for  the  agricultural  produce  and ",
  "creates \u2018ripple effect\u2019 (similar to throwing a pebble in a pond and you can see the waves ",
  "moving outwards).",
  "Industries  can  create  townships  around  them  thereby  creating  indirect  employment ",
  "(Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bhilai are a few to mention here). Industrialization is all about ",
  "focusing on the industries allowing them to meet the requirements of the economy besides ",
  "providing  linkages  to  the  agricultural  sector  and  also  employment  opportunities  in  the ",
  "economy. This can be achieved only through higher industrial growth which can provide ",
  "momentum to overall growth and also make it sustainable in future.",
  "There has been a missing link in India of the industrial/manufacturing sector, despite ",
  "policies and governmental focus, not playing its role of creating linkages with agricultural ",
  "sector and also creating desired employment opportunities. The services sector becoming ",
  "a  major  contributor  to  output  rather  than  the  manufacturing  or  the  industrial  sector. ",
  "Such sectoral composition in favour of services does happen but once industrial sector has ",
  "achieved a level of maturity emerged globally competitive and the service sector supporting ",
  "higher levels of growth of economies, which has not happened in India.",
  "Let us understand industry a bit more closely. It implies conversion of any raw material ",
  "into a finished good or a manufacturing activity producing wide range of goods which is ",
  "required in the economy. Industries can also be categorized across the following features:",
  "1.  Products\u2014basic  industries  (steel,  cement),  capital  good  industries  (manufacturing ",
  "of plant and machineries). Intermediate goods industries (manufacture of dyes, tools, ",
  "etc.,) and consumer goods industries (manufacture of cars, scooters, fridges, TV, etc.,). ",
  "The consumer goods industries are also known as \u2018White Goods Industry\u2019.",
  "2.  Ownership\u2014government (public sector), private and foreign (private sector), public ",
  "and private sector (joint sector).",
  "3.  Scale of investment in plant and machinery\u2014large industries (investment in plant ",
  "and machinery  o fover \u20b910 crores) ,medium industries (T 1-10 crores), small-scale ",
  "                 ",
  "industries(\u20b910 lakh to \u20b91 crores),villageand cottageindustries(lessthan \u20b910 lakh).88 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "4.  Capital/Labour  intensity\u2014capital  intensive  industries  (larger  capital  intensive ",
  "in relation to labour) and labour intensive industries (larger intensity of labour in ",
  "relation to capital).",
  "Economies desirous of pushing up rates of growth of their economy, would need industrial ",
  "goods for development and shift focus on setting up basic and capital goods industries ",
  "commonly known as initiation of the process of industrialization.",
  "India started its journey of industrialization during the second five-year plan (1955/56- ",
  "60/61). The pattern of industrialization in India is also known as the \u2018Mahalanobis Model\u2019 ",
  "(an  Indian  scientist)  with  the  setting  up  of  basic  and  capital  goods  industries  by  the ",
  "government directly, strongly influenced by the Russian model of state-run industries.",
  "PUBLIC SECTOR IN INDIA",
  "One  may  ask  why\u2019  public  sector  was  chosen  for  industrialization.  Post-independence ",
  "India was deeply influenced by the Soviet Union which had state-run industries and was ",
  "an era of\u2018socialism\u2019 with large role of the government in production of goods and services. ",
  "\u2018Capitalism\u2019 was associated with exploitative tendencies and having vested interest.",
  "Immediately after Independence, the private sector was virtually non-existent in India ",
  "and whatever existed did not have the maturity, resources, technology, etc., to shoulder ",
  "could  get  the  responsibility  of  the  industrialization.  The  government,  at  its  own  level ",
  "technology and other such support from other countries which may not have been possible ",
  "otherwise.",
  "Even if it is presumed that the task was entrusted to the then private sector, industrialization ",
  "would have required huge resources, technology support and well-trained manpower, which ",
  "were not available within the then private sector. Basic/capital goods industries have long ",
  "gestation period (time between investment and commercial production), high break-even ",
  "point (long period before profits accrue). These could be seen as natural dis-incentives for ",
  "the private sector at that time.",
  "Setting up public sector in India for industrialization was a conscious, well thought out ",
  "and deliberate decision given the magnitude of responsibility and the need for moving on ",
  "a pre-determined path of industrialization. The role of public sector in India was clearly ",
  "cut-out and set up with the following objectives:",
  "1.  Create significant \u2018capacities\u2019 (ability to produce) in basic and capital goods.",
  "2.  Achieve self-reliance in core areas and also facilitate import substitution.",
  "3. Attain commanding heights of the economy and become a driver for the industrial ",
  "growth and a catalyst\u2019 in accelerating overall growth of the economy.",
  "4.. Adopt pro-labour technology to create employment opportunities.",
  "5. Setting up industries in backward/tribal areas for their integration with the rest of the ",
  "economy and also for better regional development.",
  "Provide for development of the private sector.",
  "6.",
  "7. Set up self-contained townships covering residential, schools, hospitals, transport, etc. ",
  "8. Public sector to have regulated prices by the government given their importance to ",
  "the economy and not creating an upward spiral in the prices of basic goods.INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND LIBERALIZATION 89",
  "Six decades since setting up of public sector, can it be said they have delivered or achieved ",
  "the objectives?",

  "1956 which hasgiven thepresentcharacterofpublicsector.TheotheristheIndustrial90 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Policy of 1991 which is hailed as the usherer of economic reforms in India. It may not ",
  "be required to go into each and every industrial policy since 1948, however, it would be ",
  "suffice to see the salient key features of all policies pre-1991 which would facilitate a better ",
  "understanding of the Industrial Policy of 1991 and the changes brought about in the right ",
  "context.",
  "Industrial Policies (pre-1991) are as follows:",
  "(1)  The industrial sector was highly regulated, bureaucratic controls and subject to strict ",
  "licensing system by the government with the need for a licence for any industrial ",
  "activity, besides the need for compulsory registration before commencing the business.",
  "(2)  The policy of 1956 brought the role of public sector sharply by reserving as many ",
  "as eighteen areas exclusively for the public sector. In certain areas, private sector was ",
  "allowed but subject to the requirement of licence and registration. However, public ",
  "sector could also be set up in these areas if deemed necessary by the Government.",
  "(3)  Thus , most  critical  and importan t areas  of  oil , power , heavy equipments ,  ",
  "telec om,e tc.,wereexclusive ly in thed omain  ofpublicsector.",
  "(4)  Bigger  private  companies  were  highly  regulated  through  the  monopolies  and ",
  "restrictive trade practices (MRTP) act and known as MRTP companies and similarly ",
  "foreign  companies  were  regulated  through  the  Foreign  Exchange  Regulation  Act ",
  "(FERA) and known as FERA companies.",
  "(5)  It was believed by the government that as a company grows in size it can resort ",
  "to  monopolistic  and  exploitative  tendencies.  As  a  result  even  after  a  licence  and ",
  "commencing of business, the private sector had to seek approval from the government ",
  "for capacity expansion, diversification and other such business decisions.",
  "(6)  The  earlier  policies  with  a  view  to  give  public  sector  commanding  heights  and ",
  "control over key industries/services also paved the way for nationalization or take ",
  "over from private sector. Thus, coal mining, banking, insurance, textile mills (sick ",
  "industries were taken over to protect employment) earlier in the private sector, were ",
  "nationalized.",
  "(7)  The pre-1991 policies had price regulation for industrial goods with prices of steel, ",
  "cement and other basic goods controlled by the government.",
  "(8)  Each and every policy had stressed on the mixed economy character of the economy ",
  "which is co-existence of the public and private sector but in reality it was heavily ",
  "tilted towards the public sector.",
  "To summarize, the pre-1991 policies were highly regulated and regimented oriented, near ",
  "dominance of the public sector and a very limited space but with bureaucratic control over ",
  "private sector companies.",
  "NEW ECONOMIC POLICY 1991",
  "As mentioned previously, this policy is known to be the beginning of economic reforms in ",
  "India. Though reforms were there before this also but they were as changes being effected ",
  "but not seen as reforms made as explicit in the policy of 1991. It is also known as the New ",
  "Industrial Policy or the New Economic Policy, and also known as the policy of liberalization or INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND LIBERALIZATION 91",
  "end of licence/permit raj or even end of bureaucratic control over functioning of the industrial ",
  "sector, particularly private sector.",
  "The  policy  aimed  at  greater  freedom  for  doing  businesses  outside  the  government ",
  "control,  reduced  the  role  for  public  sector,  de-reserving  areas  and  larger  role  for  the ",
  "private sector, doing away with MRTP/FERA act and dispensing with MRTP and FERA ",
  "companies.  This  lifted  all  bureaucratic  control  on  their  functioning.  Price  regulation ",
  "paved a way to the market determined prices for most of the industrial goods. The policy ",
  "emphasized on greater competition and level playing field for all players.",
  "It  advocated  liberal  foreign  investment  policies  to  attract  foreign  investment  in  the ",
  "country (more about this in upcoming sections). Broadly, the New Economic Policy or ",
  "the Industrial Policy 1991 has three broad areas which are as follows:",
  "1) Liberalization.",
  "2) Public sector.",
  "3) Foreign investment.",
  "Liberalization",
  "Liberalization as a policy basically dispensed with the earlier licensing and the registration ",
  "system  providing  the  freedom  to private sector to set up  industries  without  either  the ",
  "need for a licence or a need for registration. De-licensing was the most important aspect ",
  "of the policy of liberalization. Two areas, atomic energy and railways would not be open ",
  "for private sector participation. Even while doing away with the licensing system certain ",
  "critical areas still require a licence but opened up for private sector participation which ",
  "are as follows:",
  "1) Any kind of fire arms and ammunition, explosives. ",
  "2) Drugs and pharmaceuticals.",
  "3) Coal mining.",
  "4) Defence equipments.",
  "5) All kinds of wines, cigarettes and spirits.",
  "6) Hazardous chemicals.",
  "Any environment degrading and polluting industries would not require a licence but an ",
  "administrative clearance from the respective ministries of central/state government before ",
  "investment. Further, as a part of liberalization there was now no restrictions on capacity ",
  "expansion and diversification by the private companies. The policy thus allowed the private ",
  "sector to operate as pure businesses with minimal bureaucratic control and be driven and ",
  "expand operations largely by demands in the markets and opportunities available.",
  "Why was this done? It is important to understand that even before reforms, despite the ",
  "regulations, the private sector struggled, operated within the constraints of the government ",
  "but survived and was not completely eclipsed by the public sector. The changing economic ",
  "scenario required a different orientation focused on efficiency, productivity and profitability.",
  "A time had come to acknowledge maturity of the private sector, their resilience, their ",
  "fighting spirit and that they could now share and shoulder larger responsibilities. In fact, ",
  "on the contrary, the regulations had given them the maturity of operating in a constrained ",
  "environment.92 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",

  "The policy has taken a complete \u2018U\u2019 turn from the previous policies, in announcing that",

  "                   ",

  " ",
  "On the contrary, the policy for the first time, talked of disinvestment and privatization ",
  "                 ",
  "of public sector. The third element of the New Economic Policy was the reforms in foreign ",
  "                       ",
  "investmentwhich willbediscussed in alatersection.",
  "         ",
  "Disinvestment and Privatization",
  "Both disinvestment as well as privatization is the reverse of investment. For setting up ",
  "public sector, the government had to invest by subscribing in shares of the new public ",
  "sector from budgetary resources. Thus, disinvestment and privatization both imply \u2018selling ",
  "of shares of public sector by the government\u2019. We all know that shares are traded at the ",
  "stock market and the traded value of each share is decided by the buyers and the sellers in ",
  "the market.",
  "If buyers of shares of a particular company are more than the sellers of the same, the ",
  "traded value of the shares would be at a premium\u2019 or otherwise it would be at a \u2018discount\u2019. ",
  "Thus, in both the cases of disinvestment as well as privatization, selling of shares of public ",
  "sector would be at a premium.INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND LIBERALIZATION 93",
  "To distinguish between both, ownership of companies would need to be understood. ",
  "Who is the owner of a company? He/She is a person who holds majority of the shares, ",
  "that is, 51 per cent. Technically, ownership is with the person holding a minimum 51 ",
  "per cent shares, or even a person enjoying support of 51 per cent shareholders. This can ",
  "be explained as: If you are holding 10 per cent shares of a company and you are able to ",
  "convince 41 per cent shareholders to support, then you will become the owner of the ",
  "company (similar as governments are formed). Hence, disinvestment is defined as selling ",
  "of shares of public sector at a premium, to the public, by the government without losing ",
  "ownership of the public sector. The objective here is to raise resources for the government. ",
  "These shares are  sold to the public as the  preferred and first option of making them ",
  "partners in public sector.",
  "We have talked about ownership earlier. At a still deeper level ownership of businesses ",
  "being done, as companies having shares, is always with shareholders and management is ",
  "with the person having support of 51% of the shareholders. Privatization is transferring ",
  "management control to the private sector by selling 51 per cent shares of public sector ",
  "to the private sector or even lesser but transferring management control to a group or ",
  "to a company. The objective is not so much to raise resources in as much as transferring ",
  "management  control  from  the  government  to  the  private  company.  It  is  not  a  logical ",
  "extension  of  disinvestment.  That  is,  having  disinvested  in  a  public  sector  does  not ",
  "necessarily imply that it is going to be privatized.",
  "Why did the policy of 1991 favored privatization? The policy took a mature decision ",
  "in seeking privatization of the public sector for the following reasons:",
  "(1)  The public sector as mentioned earlier had broadly delivered in terms of creating ",
  "significant  capacities  in  key  areas  such  as  self-reliance,  substituting  for  import  of ",
  "industrial  goods,  created  the  platform  for  further  industrialization  and  industrial ",
  "growth. There is a requirement now to moving into higher gears and look at issues ",
  "such as developing greater capabilities, improving productivity and efficiency, sharp ",
  "focus on profitability.",
  "(2)  The policy of liberalization has opened the gates for liberal private sector investment ",
  "in key areas and competition would only intensify. This requires the public sector ",
  "to now run as pure businesses, as a commercial venture which is possible solely in ",
  "private sector. As a public sector, there will always be a limitation of not being to ",
  "operate as a pure business in the same way as their counter pans in the private sector.",
  "(3)  The role of the government as a producer of industrial goods is always interim, ",
  "short-term and never permanent. It can be permanent producer only of those where ",
  "direct welfare of people is affected like railways or in the national interest like atomic ",
  "energy.",
  "(4)  It is also about the mindset of the government of the maturity of the private sector ",
  "and their ability to deliver the requirements better than the government.",
  "(5)  As  a  government,  it  has  larger  responsibilities  of  providing  good  and  efficient ",
  "governance,  creating  enabled  environment,  addressing  the  welfare  of  the  masses, ",
  "which  are  far  more  important  than  running  public  sector.  Especially,  when  today ",
  "there is a maturity and competence in the private sector.",
  "(6)  Why privatize a profit making public sector? Privatization is not about profit making ",
  "but for a larger reason of whether it will continue to remain profitable in future with ",
  "intense and fierce competition.94 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(7)  Thus, privatization is not for today but for a brighter future of the public sector in a ",
  "privatized environment equipped better to meet the challenges.",
  "(8)  Any business requires the ability to take prompt business decisions, it is not about ",
  "whether the decision was right or wrong. Such decisions will always have business ",
  "risks but what is required is the ability to take the decision quickly. The structure of ",
  "public sector globally is such that it suffers from delays in decision-making.",
  "(9)  Privatization is also about handing public sector to a visionary\u2019 who understands ",
  "business, understands priorities and knows how to make the public sector grow to ",
  "greater heights and help it to emerge as a global company.",
  "Keeping the above facts in view the government went for some big ticket privatization ",
  "like that of BALCO (Vedanta Group), VSNL (Tatas), IPCL (Reliance Industries), Modern ",
  "Foods  (Unilever),  and  Maruti  (Suzuki).  Even  Round  1  of  privatization  was  performed ",
  "amidst lot of controversy ranging from the need to issues of valuation.",
  "Why the opposition to privatization? The reasons are detailed as follows:",
  "(1)  It was feared that government owned monopolies would be replaced by private sector ",
  "monopolies and could result in exploitation by the private sector. The government has ",
  "clarified that no public sector operating as a monopoly would be privatized. Only those ",
  "which are operating in a competitive environment would be privatized. Until they are ",
  "able to operate in a competitive environment there would only be disinvestment of ",
  "such public sector.",
  "(2)  It is also feared that privatization would result in a large number of workers laid off ",
  "or would lose their jobs thereby adding to the pool of unemployment. It needs to be ",
  "understood that public sector being specialized in nature, the workers by virtue of ",
  "experience have acquired a skill set which no owner would like to lose. Rather than ",
  "retrench they would be redeployed.",
  "(3)  It is also widely believed that proceeds received from disinvestment and privatization ",
  "would be used to meet the budgetary deficit and not used for the benefit of the ",
  "masses or used to create social assets in the economy.",
  "(a)  The government has already set up the National Investment Fund (NIF) for ",
  "parking of funds received from disinvestment.",
  "(b)  Further, the corpus would not be used but the returns from the corpus by their ",
  "investment in profitable avenues, would be used 75 per cent for creating social ",

  "and also meeting the expansion needs of the profitable public sector units.",
  "(c)  The corpus of the NIF would be managed by UTI mutual fund, SBI and LIC.",
  "(4)  Given the high level of fiscal deficit it would be difficult for the government to desist ",
  "from reducing the deficit through proceeds of disinvestment and privatization.",
  "Despite the merit and the need for privatization the government rightfully is not considering ",
  "any further privatization and would rather wait for consensus building amongst political ",
  "parties, trade unions before privatization as it is a long protracted process spanning several ",
  "decades.",
  "Both  liberalization  as  well  as  privatization  are  the  major  planks  of  the  economic ",

  "when public sector was set up. Privatization at its best provide only for an efficient and ",
  "competitive domestic industrial base and cannot be said as the \u2018only\u2019 aspect of reforms. There ",
  "are so many other softer reforms (relatively easy to implement through an executive order of ",
  "the government), which could have been done. Despite the policy of liberalization there are ",

  "There is still a lot of bureaucratic interface for performing business in India and that is ",

  "ROLE OF PUBLIC SECTOR IN FUTURE",
  "The  NEP  1991  has  given  rise  to  certain  wrong  perceptions  about  the  public  sector, ",
  "mentioned earlier, \u2018clipping of their wings\u2019, or \u2018diluting the status of public sector\u2019. It needs ",
  "to be clarified first that it is not the clipping of wings but only a larger role for private ",
  "sector. Neither is the status being diluted given the huge investments and asset base of the ",
  "public sector in the country. The policy should not be seen as undermining the importance ",
  "of public sector, but role of public sector would undergo a change as mentioned below:",
  "(1)  From  a  welfare  orientation  they  would  shift  to  function  as  a  commercial  venture ",
  "with profits as an objective to the extent feasible as a public sector.",
  "2)  From production-oriented they would become productivity-oriented.",
  "3)  They will operate with greater professionalism and well run public sector would ",
  "operate with greater operational and functional autonomy to the extent feasible.",
  "(a)  Many  more  public  sector  would  acquire  the  status  of  \u2018Mini-navrattan, ",
  "Navrattan  and  Maharatnas\u2019,  yielding  them  a  greater  degree  of  freedom  for ",
  "taking investment decisions by the respective boards of public sector and not ",
  "requiring government approval.",
  "4)  There would be consolidation and likelihood of mergers amongst public sector such ",
  "as oil companies, nationalized banks to enable them to achieve greater economies of ",
  "scale and help them to compete with global companies.",
  "5)  Many public sectors may opt for overseas acquisitions paving the way for public ",
  "sector to become global players.",
  "6)  There is a likelihood of public sector getting into joint ventures with private sector ",
  "and greater joint participation in key areas.",
  "The chief executive officer of public sector would be considered for appointment ",
  "based on merit and competence both within as well as outside the government.96 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(8)  There would be a level playing field with the private sector allowing for healthy ",
  "competition.",
  "(9)  Gradually, their monopoly status would get diluted with entry of private and foreign ",
  "companies  and  they  would  not  be  at  commanding  heights\u2019  of  the  economy  but ",
  "operate along with private and foreign companies.",
  "(10)  Efforts would be made to address the loss making public sector by exploring all ",
  "avenues for their revival through capital infusion, waiving off accumulated losses ",
  "so that they can start afresh on a clean slate. However, all such revivals of the loss ",
  "making public sector may come with a \u2018rider\u2019, that this revival would be subject to ",
  "privatization subsequently.",
  "(11)  However, the biggest challenge before the profitable public sector would be their ",
  "ability to be competitive, productive and efficient and remain profitable in future.",

  "Realizing  its  importance  the  government  has  set  up  the  \u2018National  Company  Law ",
  "Tribunal\u2019 as a one stop shop, single reference point for all sick companies either seeking ",
  "revival or closure within a period of twenty-four months of the case filed with NCLT. This ",
  "would bring under one roof all the multiple bodies together to work in a coordinated ",
  "manner either for revival or for the closure of companies in a time bound manner, The ",
  "NCLT is yet to become operational as it requires amendments to various \u2018acts\u2019 and also ",
  "compliance of legal formalities.",
  "An exit policy also has a ticklish issue which is labour-related and is a larger freedom ",
  "to  the  management  of  companies  in  addressing  labour-related  issues.  That  is,  if  there ",
  "is  freedom  to  recruit  there  should  also  be  discretion  to  a  company  to  dismiss  in  the ",
  "larger  interests  of  the  company.  Unfortunately,  all  the  labour  laws  have  been  enacted ",
  "during 1920s and 1930s to protect the interests of the workers in the industrial sector ",
  "and  making  dismissing  labour  as  virtually  impossible  with  fears  of  strikes  and  labour ",
  "unrest.",
  "This has given rise to complacency, non-productive workers and a complete mismatch ",
  "between  salaries  paid  and  the  output  of  workers.  As  long  as  the  Indian  market  was ",
  "sheltered, large role of public sector these could be tolerated but in todays environment ",
  "with increased competition productivity and efficiency have become critical for survival ",
  "of companies.",
  "Labour has to realize that \u2018in the growth of the companies lies their future\u2019 and not ",
  "the other way around. Thus, labour reforms would involve factoring in productivity and ",
  "linking salaries to productivity. Many feel that this will bring back the \u2018hire and fire\u2019 ",
  "policy which had forced the government earlier to enact labour laws to protect interests of ",
  "labour.",
  "Labour reform is most controversial and no political party would like to touch given ",
  "the likely fall-out, even going out of power. Let us get the facts straight first. All labour ",
  "laws are there to protect the interest of 6-8 per cent of the workforce in the organized ",
  "sector while the remaining 90 per cent and above engaged in the unorganized sector are ",
  "outside the purview of labour laws.",
  "Which sector needs protection: the organized or the unorganized sector? Clearly it is ",
  "the vulnerable unorganized sector. Second, employment in the organized sector is \u2018skilled\u2019 ",
  "and today most economies including India are feeling the pinch of shortage of skilled ",
  "manpower. Companies would like to preserve the skill set acquired out of experience. ",
  "If the labour has the skills and a willing worker why will be he thrown out? Times have ",
  "changed and employee retention instead is a big challenge for companies today.",
  "Thirdly, all the labour laws have been framed much before Independence and surely ",
  "working environment has undergone a sea change which is not captured by these laws. ",
  "Further, there is confusion over basic definitions, such as workmen, wages, employee, etc. ",
  "Factory, etc., are all defined differently in different \u2018acts\u2019.104 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "Provisions  under  factories  act  do  not  match  provisions  under  minimum  wages  act. ",
  "In fact, all these acts are not only out of time but provided for rigidity and excessive ",
  "regulatory legislations in the economy and as mentioned previously only for 6-8 per cent ",
  "of the workforce in the organized sector.",
  "Fourthly, has it occurred that despite the increased industrial growth it has not led to ",
  "increased  employment  opportunities  in  the  organized  sector  as  the  prevalent  stringent ",
  "labour laws have forced the companies to substitute labour with labour displacing capital, ",
  "greater automation which is ironical for a labour surplus country like India.",
  "Fifthly, realization is required amongst labour that the priority is to first protect the ",
  "interest of the company and if that is protected their interest would also get protected. ",
  "Labour and management have to become partners in the process of improving productivity ",
  "as well as protecting the interests of the company.",
  "Agreed,  no  matter  how  much  be  the  compulsion  for  labour  reforms  in  the  larger ",
  "interest of the economy, it may be difficult to attempt given the democratic framework ",
  "and fragile political set-up and cannot be pushed down as done in China.",
  "However, at least a beginning can be made by reviewing the different labour laws, ",
  "making  them  more  comprehensive,  removing  duplications  and  ambiguities  in  different ",
  "acts, having a uniform definition of a \u2018worker or labour\u2019. That should not be difficult. The ",
  "government can also initiate dialogue with political parties and representatives of various ",
  "trade unions emphasizing upon the need for such reforms and arriving at a broad-based ",
  "consensus.",
  "What is appalling is the government disinterest to even start thinking on these lines. ",
  "Labour reforms in India is the hardest of reforms and has the potential of unleashing ",
  "a  storm,  a  great  upheaval,  and  can  have  a  grave  political  fallouts  and  has  to  tread ",
  "carefully  and  gradually  by  building  consensus  step-by-step.  Until  such  a  time  it  may ",
  "delay  further  reforms  and  the  correct  way  for  going  ahead  is  to  make a modest  and ",
  "acceptable  beginning.  At  the  same  time  it  should  also  be  kept  in  mind,  that  without ",
  "changing the labor environment and with present levels of protection through multiple ",
  "trade unions, would only imply not getting full benefits of reforms for which reforms ",
  "cannot be blamed.",
