  "PLANNING IN INDIA",
  "GENESIS",
  "Planning  in  post-independence  India  has  been  driven  by  the  five-year  plans  which ",
  "is a horizon of five years with a mid-term review and then the next five-year plan. In ",
  "exceptional years of wars and other such situations, India has also opted for annual plans. ",
  "also known as \u2018plan holiday\u2019, a break from the five-year plans.",
  "There was also a concept of rolling plan which also has a horizon of five years, bur ",
  "allowing for corrections mid-term or even annually depending on the performance under ",
  "various heads. However, primarily in India, it has been the five-year plans with each plar. ",
  "having a mid-term review.",
  "Planning in India is centralized, which provides a macro framework of developmental ",
  "and investment needs, mobilization of resources to achieve desired levels of growth. The ",
  "responsibility of planning in India vests with the Planning Commission which is not a ",
  "statutory body, headed by a Deputy Chairman and the Prime Minister as the Chairman ",
  "of Planning Commission. The plans are formulated by the Planning Commission and are ",
  "approved by the National Development Council (NDC) with the Prime Minister as its ",
  "Chairman.",
  "The Government of India, in keeping with its reform agenda, constituted the NITI ",
  "Aayog to replace the Planning Commission instituted in 1950. This was done in order to ",
  "better serve the needs and aspirations of the people of India. An important evolutionary ",
  "change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quintessential platform of the Government ",
  "of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative ",
  "Federalism.",
  "The National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog, was formed ",
  "via a resolution of the Union Cabinet on January 1, 2015. NITI Aayog is the premier ",

  "PLANNING AND MARKET ECONOMY",
  "It is widely believed that planning is relevant for developing economies and absence of a ",
  "market mechanism results in most economic decisions being taken by the government.PLANNING IN INDIA 203",
  "As economies get market-oriented, the role of planning gets diluted as decisions get taken ",
  "efficiently by the markets. This is actually an incorrect way of looking at planning and ",
  "market economy as substitutes. Both have different set of objectives. Planning gives a ",
  "direction  to the economy  and market  economy  gives  efficiency  in use  of resources , ",
  "investments and production in an economy.",
  "Planning  is  much  broader  and  it  offers  a  macro perspective, vision of the  country ",
  "into the future, chart out a growth path, required levels of savings and investments to ",
  "achieve desired levels of growth. It also provides how to allocate precious scarce resources ",
  "to competing end uses. It ensures complementarity of investments and a more balanced, ",
  "equitable development and distribution in an economy.",
  "More  fundamentally,  it  also  seeks  to  balance  demand  on  public  resources  leaving ",
  "sufficient for future generations to come and at the same time the present requirements are ",
  "also met. Market economy does not allow for these, as a market economy is restricted to ",
  "decisions taken by the market for efficiency in production activities and does not allow focus ",
  "on national priorities and needs. As a market economy, there is still a need for direction ",
  "which is what planning is able to provide.",
  "INDIA AND FIVE-YEAR PLANS",
  "Directed Planning (PI\u2014P6)",
  "India\u2019s  five-year  plans  commenced  with  the  first-five  year  plan  spanning  1951-1952 ",
  "to 1955\u20141956, with a modest overall growth target of 2.1 per cent. With just having ",
  "becoming an independent country, objective was on increasing agricultural sector growth ",
  "and balance development while keeping inflation under check. Being the first plan, targets ",
  "were fairly modest and emphasis was on consolidation.",
  "It was fromt hese cond five-yearpl an (1956-1957 to 1960-1961)tha tpla nning in thetrue ",

  "plan,which wasc reatin g significan tcapacitiesin both c apitalasw ellascoreindus trie sby  the ",
  "gove rnment.    ",
  "The emphasis of this model was on achieving self-reliance and also the ability to meet ",
  "the needs of the domestic economy. This plan is known for a top-down industrialization ",
  "of the big industries creating a base for the growth of medium and small-scale industries ",
  "and going down to village and cottage industries. It also gave birth to the concept of public ",
  "sector  of  state  run  enterprises  based  on  the  Russian  model  of  industrialization.  Public ",
  "sector was also envisioned as to meet broad socio-welfare objectives in the economy.",
  "Most of the public sector in India was set up during this plan period and also known ",
  "as the industrialization or the public sector plan. With the first plan target for overall ",
  "growth surpassed the second plan which had set out an ambitious target of 4.5 per cent ",
  "for the five-year period, but managed only an average growth of 3.9 per cent during the ",
  "plan period.",
  "The third five-year plan (1961-1962 to 1965-1966) had proposed a larger thrust on ",
  "industrialization but the war with China and subsequently Pakistan, quite destabilized204 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "the third plan because of the changing priorities of the war, and resulted in a plan holiday ",
  "from 1966-1967 to 1968-1969. Towards the end of the third plan, the plan holiday had ",
  "a great contribution in ushering in the green revolution which increased the productivity ",
  "of crops like wheat by using high-yielding varieties of seeds.",
  "The  fourth  plan  (1969-1970  to  1973-1974)  was  rebuilding  the  economy  with  the ",
  "scarce resources that had got diverted towards war and aimed at growth with stability, ",
  "greater self-reliance especially in defence, as a fall out of the war and increased vulnerability ",
  "of more such wars in the future.",
  "The fifth plan (1974-1975 to 1978-1979) for the first time actually addressed the issue ",
  "of removal of poverty as a prime objective.",
  "However, it was sixth plan (1980\u20141981 to 1984-1985), it was realized that the growth ",
  "by itself was not sufficient, for one, they were not sufficiently high enough to address ",
  "the larger issues of poverty in the country and the other being that there were structural ",
  "rigidities. This plan made a frontal attack on poverty; when the then Prime Minister, late ",
  "Smt. Indira Gandhi gave the slogan of 'Garibi Hatao.",
  "It marks the transformation from allocating scarce resources in the economy, to welfare ",
  "orientation with focus on specific programs for poverty alleviation. These were not new ",
  "schemes, however, all different schemes were combined as one scheme and known as the ",
  "Integrated rural development programme (IRDP). It was the first plan to focus on gender ",
  "issues, women empowerment and the growing inequalities amongst the states and also ",
  "intra-regional imbalances.",
  "From Pl to P6 five-year plan, they were directed plans as there was a large role of ",
  "public sector and substantially larger investment by the government or the government ",
  "could ensure investment in specific areas as it was the major investor. The general overtone ",
  "in these five-year plans was towards industrialization, setting up of the public sector, self- ",
  "reliance  and  establishing  India  as  a  self-generating  economy,  to  provide  employment ",
  "and meeting the needs of the economy, rather than they being provided directly by the ",
  "government. Towards P5 and more in P6, poverty' and welfare orientation of the plans ",
  "became visible.",
  "Indicative Planning (P7 onwards)",
  "The  seventh  plan  (1985\u20141986  to  1989-1990)  had  two important  aspects, one that of, ",
  "larger  agricultural  sector  orientation  of  increasing  production  and  productivity  and  the ",
  "second that of, a steady decline in the public sector investment falling to below 50 per cent ",
  "of the total outlay, implying a larger contribution from private sector in the total outlay ",
  "of the plan.",
  "It was the plan which recorded the highest ever agricultural and overall growth of 10.4 ",
  "per cent in 1988-1989; however, this was largely due  to the  lower  base  of  the  previous ",
  "year with ag rowth ofo nly 3.8 percen t.Ith as expe rienced forthe fi rstt ime,a probl em  ofimpo rts ",

  "These adverse developments again forced the government to opt for a plan holiday from ",
  "1990 to 1992. As in the previous plan period, even this resulted in the launch of economic ",
  "reforms also known as the New Economic Policy 1991, which has been discussed earlier ",
  "in the section on public sector. Each successive plan after P7 has seen a phased reduction ",
  "in public sector outlay and larger levels of private sector, changing planning from \u2018directed ",
  "to indicative\u2019, which is, indicating which sectors require investment in terms of priorities ",
  "and private sector expected to make that investment.",
  "The  eighth  plan  (1992-1993  to  1996-1997),  besides  the  objectives  of  increasing ",
  "growth, agricultural production mentioned the need for attaining self-sufficiency* in food ",
  "grains. It, for the first time, brought the need for strengthening infrastructure especially in ",
  "the areas of energy, transport, communications and energy.",

  "Twelfth plan which covers years 2012 to 2017 focuses on instilling \u201cinclusive growth' . ",
  "The plan is expected to be one that encourages the development of India\u2019s agriculture, ",
  "education, health and social welfare through government spending. It is also expected to ",
  "create employment through developing India\u2019s manufacturing sector and move the nation ",
  "higher up the value chain.",
  "The planning commission will strive to enact policies that will achieve somewhere ",
  "around a 10% growth rate in factories and a 4% growth rate in farm produce, though Prime ",
  "Minister has asked to set the nations growth rate firmly at 9 per cent to 9.5%.",
  "An important aspect of generating \u201cinclusive growth\u201d is shifting target of government aid ",
  "to rural areas. Typically, large projects such as power generation, roads whereby freight can ",
  "travel, and airports receive the lion\u2019s share of government subsidies, while rural infrastructure ",
  "receives comparatively little.",
  "Rural infrastructure, which serves 70 per cent of the population, doesn\u2019t get the attention ",
  "it deserves. As the Planning Commission sets out to draft the country\u2019s planned investments ",
  "for the next five years, it is important to take note of this gap, and the innovative solutions ",

  "CHALLENGES BEFORE TWELFTH PLAN ",
  "(2012-2013 TO 2016-2017)",
  "The twelfth plan would have the following challenges:208 THE INDIAN ECONOMY",
  "(1)  A  bigger  challenge than  Pll of providing for inclusive growth or the ability to ",
  "provide broad-based benefits to the masses.",
  "(2)  Planning would increasingly become indicative with larger role of private sector in ",
  "the total outlay.",
  "(3)  The challenge will be on improving agricultural production and productivity given ",
  "the  near  stagnation  levels.  Their  commercialization,  adoption  of  biotechnology, ",
  "access to finance, land reforms, etc., have all remained a challenge in the previous ",
  "plans, but a larger challenge before twelfth plan, especially as it falls within the ",
  "domains of the state government with limited central government interventions.",
  "(4)  Infrastructure investment and the requirement of long-term resources are the more ",
  "important needs for coordinated and an effective infrastructure.",
  "(5)  Poverty continues to be the major issue and also a major limitation of not having the ",
  "actual number especially in recent times. This does not allow an understanding of the ",
  "impact  of  schemes  like  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee ",
  "Scheme (MGNREGS) and other social sector programmes of recent times. There ",
  "is also a need to leverage technology in this area, for appropriate corrections in ",
  "policies.",
  "(6)  The need for labour sector reforms cannot be more than the present because of their ",
  "links with creating employment opportunities with increased growth in future.",
  "(7)  Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) would be acting as an important role not only ",
  "for decentralized planning but also in implementation of various programmes. The ",
  "challenge will be in evolving them as \u2018effective\u2019 institutions for better delivery in the ",
  "economy.",
  "(8)  The  eleventh  plan  had  mentioned  about  the  growing  \u2018divide\u2019  across  regions  of ",
  "increased inter- and intra-regional divides and also exclusivity of the NE states in ",
  "overall  development  process.  Strategies for bridging  this  divide would  also be a ",
  "challenge.",
  "(9)  Skill  formation  has  engaged  the  attention  of  the  central  government  but  would ",
  "require greater thrust as actionable targets and sensitizing the state governments of ",
  "their larger role in skill formation.",
  "(10)  All the plans since eighth plan can be seen as more or less as a five-year \u2018ritual\u2019 unlike ",
  "the earlier plans which were intellectually stimulating.",
  "Hope the twelfth plan will be path-breaking, different from the earlier plans, forcing the ",
  "government and the others to think and provide a greater credibility and respect to the five ",
  "year plans and also Planning Commission.",
